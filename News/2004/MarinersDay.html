			<h2>Mariners Day</h2>
			Saturday 24th January 2004
			<p />
			As we now live in the US, we are now of course keen baseball fans.  In fact we are even season ticket holders.
			<p />
			The season actually starts in April, but everything starts up in January - winter training, player moves and of course the official stadium fan day.
			<p />
			The Seattle team is the Mariners, who are actually pretty good.  Last season we were actually leading our division until summer arrived and we forgot how to hit the ball.  Two months later the damage had been done and once we started winning again it was too late.
			<p />
			Unfortunately we missed the playoffs (even though we were clearly the better side in the American league) (I HATE THE YANKIES).
			<p />
			So one Saturday in January we all decided to go to the stadium to look around, it's quite cool as you can go in the locker rooms, batting cages and catch a ball on the field.
			<p />
			As with anything I really wanted to do there was a catch.  The day we had brought tickets for was the same day as my motor cycle test, and as I had ordered my Harley-Davidson I wasn't going to miss the test.
			<p />
			As a result Lisa took the kids and met up with Gerry, Pauline and Lee from work at the stadium while I attended the last day of my bike course.  The idea being as soon as I could get away, I would meet them there.
			<p />
			Lisa took the camera so the pictures are all down to her. (Well done babe)
			<p />
			I obviously passed my test and came top of the class (did you expect anything else?) and got to the stadium around 2pm.
			<p />
			Lisa the kids and everyone else had been there a couple of hours and had gone round the changing rooms (even visited Bret Boone's locker :-) and I found them queuing to hit a ball in the batting cage.
			<p />
			We all had a go, some of us did better than others (no names - but I did well) and we walked round the ground.
			<p />
			There were quite a lot of people there, but it still looked empty, I'm not sure what the stadium's capacity is but it's a big place and seemed deserted.
			<p />
			Gerry and Lee had a go at pitching, where their throw speed was measured, Gerry was rubbish and Lee couldn't get above 60 mph.  Professionals throw fastballs in the high 90's - amazing.
			<p />
			It was actually fun walking around, but it was a very cold day and I think most of us were pleased when we finally got back in the car.
			<p />
			Next year I will go for the whole day so I can pay proper homage to Boone's locker.
