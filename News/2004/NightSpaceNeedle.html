			<h2>A Night at the Space Needle</h2>
			Sunday 22nd February 2004
			<p />
			One thing Lisa and I have wanted to do was visit the Space Needle at night.
			<p />
			Again with Nikki and the boys visiting we thought this would be a fun thing to do.  As a result we went downtown on their last night to see what Seattle would look like at night time.
			<p />
			We had a bad time trying to park but managed to get up the needle in time to see the sun set.
			<p />
			It was really beautiful, and although I got some nice pictures I don't think they really captured the amazing view.
			<p />
			It was a pretty clear night so we could see for miles and the lit up city looked magnificent.
			<p />
			I would have liked to have stayed up there longer but the boys were tired and starting to act up so after 40 minutes or so we headed for home.
			<p />
			I really recommend that if you haven't done this, you should go for it.  You won't be disappointed.
