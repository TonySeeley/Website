			<h2>Victoria Trip</h2>
			Monday 16th February 2004
			<p />
			Nikki, Jordan and Regan were visiting again from England and we wanted to do something different.
			<p />
			We have a few friends who had taken the Victoria Clipper to Victoria on Vancouver Island and told us it was a fun day out.  As a result Lisa booked some tickets to take Nikki and the boys.
			<p />
			Booking in advance was a very good idea, we paid $180 for the 3 adults and all the children went free.
			<p />
			There is always a down side with a day trip like this, the main one being here we had to board the boat at 7:30am in the morning.  As the clipper left from downtown Seattle this required the major task of getting everyone up dressed and breakfasted at the crack of dawn.
			<p />
			We made it however without any major issues and even found the car park in Seattle.
			<p />
			The sad thing about the day was the weather was looking miserable, it was very cloudy and periodically raining, I just knew the crossing was going to be rough and I am a terrible sailor.
			<p />
			We got to the boat without any issues and climbed on board.  As there was six of us and the Clipper was pretty full, the crew gave us what they called the "VIP" seating  area, which I think was the crew rest area up by the bridge.
			<p />
			This was great, we basically had an area all to ourselves, even our own toilet, all very cool.
			<p />
			This allowed the boys to run riot and make loads of noise without upsetting 200 other people on the boat.
			<p />
			We left Elliot Bay on time and headed out into Puget Sound.  The Clipper really travels fast and even though the weather sucked the crossing was OK.
			<p />
			The entire journey took around two hours so it wasn't too bad.
			<p />
			We arrived in Victoria and got through immigration without any issues.  As we didn't have any checked luggage we got through quickly and within 20 minutes found ourselves in Canada.
			<p />
			It was around this time that it started to rain :-(
			<p />
			Not to be down hearted we pressed on and walked into town.  Victoria was quite strange as it was almost like an English city.  They had loads of UK shops and Lisa got really excited.
			<p />
			We started by going to the tourist information place as Lisa wanted to visit a place called Crystal Gardens.  Once we had directions we decided we would get something to eat and give the rain a chance to stop.
			<p />
			We found a little caf√© called Sam's Place were we warned ourselves up with chili, coffee and sandwiches.
			<p />
			We then left to go to Crystal Gardens.
			<p />
			Unfortunately the rain was still coming down, so we popped into a corner shop to buy the kids some hats.  All three boys got Canada hats and Nikki brought a very sexy woolly number.
			<p />
			It was one of those shops that sold loads of touristy stuff and quite a lot of rubbish.  Lisa and Nikki were immediately drawn to the tourist stuff and boys to the rubbish.  So we brought loads.
			<p />
			Around the corner we found Crystal Gardens, this was quite cool, it was like a large tropical green house and was a great change from the miserable weather outside.
			<p />
			They had loads of exotic birds and plants and even some monkeys.  They even had a butterfly farm in the middle and I got some cool pictures.
			<p />
			One disappointment was they were supposed to have some very small monkeys you could hold, Lisa had been talking about this all the way there, so it was disappointing when we couldn't find them (clearly they were very very small monkeys).
			<p />
			Out of Crystal Gardens we found the rain still coming down, so we went looking for something else indoors to do.  Round the corner we found Miniature World.  This was basically an exhibition of models representing different points in history, children's nursery rhymes and classic literature.
			<p />
			I have to say I thought it was going to be really boring, but was quite impressed with what we found inside.  They had literally hundreds of models, some very intricate that must have taken many hours to create.  We all enjoyed it, even the boys.
			<p />
			Back outside the rain had eased off and Lisa and Nikki decided it was shopping time.
			<p />
			So we walked round a small mall and all the shops.
			<p />
			Amazingly the only person to buy anything was me, I wanted a pair of Levis and found a Levis outlet.
			<p />
			Lisa and Nikki seemed satisfied just window shopping!!! WHAT A RESULT :-)
			<p />
			We did find an English sweet shop however and spent some time in that talking to the English lady behind the counter and buying real Cadbury's chocolate.  Unfortunately for Lisa, Nikki had just arrived from the UK with a suitcase full of Cadbury's so Lisa didn't see the point in buying anything.
			<p />
			We decided at this point to make our way slowly back to the Clipper as we wanted to try and get the "VIP" area again.
			<p />
			On the way we visited the "Under the Sea Aquarium" which was basically an aquarium on a boat docked next to the Clipper.  This was quite cool too as once on the boat you went down stairs and saw loads of fish tanks below water level.  Obviously the idea being you were really looking into the sea, which didn't even fool the boys who all agreed early on they were looking at fish tanks.
			<p />
			However they had one massive tank that a diver went in and talked to us while we watched his every move.  He showed us local fish and crabs and even an Octopus (the boys loved that one).
			<p />
			After the aquarium it was time to board the Clipper so we returned back to the Clipper dock.
			<p />
			We were a bit unlucky as the "VIP" area had just been given to another family so we missed that.  We ended up in the cheep seats with everyone else, we did however get 6 seats together which was great.
			<p />
			Two hours later we arrived home in Seattle, again getting though immigration quickly.
			<p />
			As everyone was hungry we ate at the Spaghetti Factory which was across the road from the clipper dock.
			<p />
			After dinner we headed home, all of us exhausted after a long day.
			<p />
			To help keep Abi awake, Regan sang all the way home which kept us in fits of laughter.
			<p />
			We will definitely go to Victoria again it was great, but next time we'll do it in Summer.
