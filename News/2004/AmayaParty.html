			<h2>Amaya's Birthday Party</h2>
			Saturday 25th January 2004
			<p />
			Amaya Dennis is a young lady who knows what she wants, and what she wanted on her 4th birthday was bowling and pizza.  So we all went bowling.
			<p />
			It was actually quite good fun as there were not too many people there and parents played in one alley while kids had another.
			<p />
			I took along my new camera and spent most of the time discussing its technical merits with David's dad Steve, who also had just brought the same camera. (I particularly liked David's 'Wallace' from 'Wallace and Grommit' impersonation - check out picture 15)
			<p />
			The adults present included, David and Linda, David's parents Steve and Sona, Linda's parents Joanie and Hal, Dustin and Jackie, Lisa and I.  The kids were James, Jacob, Amaya and Dustin and Jackie's son, Joshua (who goes to pre-school with Amaya).  Abi was also there, but not allowed to bowl (as she can't stand on her own yet or lift a ball).
			<p />
			We all split up into our allies and played a couple of games.  All I can say is Dustin clearly had a misspent youth as he played really well and beat everyone.
			<p />
			Despite historically having the perfect build for an international bowler, I suck, so played really badly.  However Lisa sucks more so at least I beat her.
			<p />
			All the kids had the automatic gutter rails pop up when it was their go, so they got (I think Lisa) an artificially high score and I would have beaten them too if they had played properly.
			<p />
			Amaya was hysterical, she bowled so slowly, I swear sometimes the ball didn't make it to the pins.  This caused a problem once, that David sorted out by walking down the alley (in the gutter) to get the ball.  All very funny.
			<p />
			After bowling we all went back to Amaya's house to open her presents.
			<p />
			Being a guy I can't remember anything she got (even what we brought her), but I know she was happy and had a great time.
