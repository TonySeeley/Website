			<h2>Linda's Party</h2>
			Saturday 30th January 2004
			<p />
			For Linda's birthday she wanted to do something different and decided we should all go kart racing.
			<p />
			This was great fun, as when we turned up we basically had the facilities to ourselves.
			<p />
			Linda invited Chuck and Mary Lou who live in our road, Dustin and Jackie (who couldn't make it as Jackie was ill) and Lisa and me.
			<p />
			When we got there we had to wait 10 minutes for the others to arrive so I spent all my time pinning over the beautiful Harley-Davidson V-Rod on display in the window.
			<p />
			We all had to provide race names, I was 'The Snail' (The idea being it was to be a funny joke as I was dead fast - unfortunately it was quite an accurate name as I suck at kart racing too).
			<p />
			Once we had signed in and accepted the on premise disclaimer that if any of us die in a fatal kart accident the house is not to blame, we had to sit through the safety presentation.
			<p />
			This basically involved being shown multiple flags and told what they mean.  The poor guy that worked there put up with multiple, Â‘What was the Blue one for again?' questions and then sent us off to get our protective gear.
			<p />
			By protective gear, I of course mean smelly sweaty old helmets.  As the helmets had clearly been all worn by thousands of smelly 14 year olds, we were given smelly sweaty hats to put on under the helmet.  I say hat, they were more like female Amish headwear.  (As Linda nicely models in picture 2).
			<p />
			So once we got our Amish hats and helmets on we were allowed to sit in our karts.
			<p />
			Once in the kart we had to wear neck braces and seatbelts, which I felt was a little overkill until I saw how David drove round the course - quite honestly we should have been given body armour and wrapped in cotton wool too.
			<p />
			We started with all six of us on the track, we had 20 laps to do to get the feel of the kart and 'Get Warmed Up' (what ever that means).
			<p />
			After the 20 laps we decided to split up into two heats, boys on their own and girls on their own.  It was felt by some that the girls were in the way, I however liked having someone to overtake.
			<p />
			So we each had 16 laps to get our best overall qualifying time.  This qualifying would position us all in the final 'BIG' race at the end of the evening.
			<p />
			I have included the driver names and best times below, what shocked us was that the lap record was 18 seconds which was pretty much 2 seconds faster that all of us.  We couldn't figure out where they got the speed from.
			<p />

			</table>
			<p />
			This really was a lot of fun though, the karts had a top speed of (I think the guy said) around 35 mph, but because you were so low, it seemed faster.
			<p />
			In the last girl qualification race Mary Lou decided she didn't want to go out so David went instead.  Ironically he got his best time and the fastest time overall in this heat, but the guys who run the place said it didn't count as it wasn't his heat.  (This was clearly a very good decision :-)
			<p />
			Soon it was time for the final race, our positions were based on our times above so we all got in our karts.
			<p />
			I would like at this time to start to provide excuses for why I came third, I was going to say that overtaking was almost impossible, but David managed it and won, so I can't use that one.  Then I could say I had a weight disadvantage, being much heavier than everyone else, but I have lost so much weight recently I can't even claim that.  The bottom line is I suck at sport, depressing but true.
			<p />
			So the winner of the night was David, followed closely by Chuck and then me.
			<p />
			We did receive first, second and third trophies, and even had our pictures taken on the podium.
			<p />
			It turned out to be a really fun night and we all can't weight to go again.
			<p />
			[We did take loads more pictures than the ones shown here, but unfortunately most didn't come out, I guess people were just going too fast]
