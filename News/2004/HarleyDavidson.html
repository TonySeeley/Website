			<h2>My Harley-Davidson</h2>
			Sunday 22nd February 2004
			<p />
			As far back as I can remember I have always wanted to own a Harley-Davidson motor cycle.  Lets face it they are just cool.
			<p />
			It was just something I would never have thought likely living in England, apart from the cost aspect, riding a motor cycle in England is just scary.
			<p />
			I had an old Yamaha 125 about 12 years ago, I used to use it to get to and from work.  It was not much fun, always breaking down and due to the size of the roads and average speeds people drive in the UK, quite dangerous.
			<p />
			Another reason I wouldn't have thought of buying a Harley before is that I didn't want people to say, "Wow look at that bike, cool, don't like the saddle bags though!" of course the inference being the bike didn't have any saddle bags.  No, it's no good, I don't care how cool the bike is, nobody wants to see some fat guy on a motorbike.
			<p />
			So I had kind of ruled out the idea.
			<p />
			Last year I started losing weight and I decided to set myself a target goal and picked a reward if I made it.
			<p />
			My goal was I wanted to be the same weight I was when I got married, my reward, a new Harley-Davison.
			<p />
			To ensure I would be safe on the roads I also promised Lisa I would attend a safety course, which I did in January.  Part of the course included the written and practical bike test, both of which I passed.
			<p />
			Back in December I went looking for my new Harley.  At first I wanted a Fat Boy Soft Tail.  I thought it would be quite cool to be a thin boy on a fat boy.  However, I had been told by some experienced bikers that fat boys were not that much fun to ride.  Apparently they had quite hard suspension and shook your teeth out.
			<p />
			While looking in the shop I saw this amazing red monster.  I asked the salesman what the bike was as I had never seen one like it before.
			<p />
			It was the new Road King Custom, just out, fully chromed up, lower suspension and seat, big headlight with a chrome wind deflector and Californian beach bar handle bars.  Very, very cool.
			<p />
			The problem was that it was also very popular and could take a while to arrive.  What the hell I thought, I still had to lose 25 lbs to reach my target and at that time I hadn't passed my bike test.
			<p />
			I placed the deposit and sat back and waited.
			<p />
			So, 25 lbs later (102 lbs in all - that's 7 stone 2 lbs for the Brits), my new Harley-Davidson arrived.
			<p />
			Metallic Lava Red, looking as cool as ever.
			<p />
			I had a couple of extra's added too, some really cool sounding pipes (exhaust mufflers) for that one in a million Harley sound, a detachable Sissy Bar (back rest for passengers) and a detachable Road King wind deflector (for those windy long journeys to Sturgis :-)
			<p />
			It also arrived the week Nikki, Jordan and Regan were visiting so I got the chance to take them all out for a spin.
			<p />
			As I write this I have had the bike for just over a week, ridden 200 miles and spent 2 hours on Sunday cleaning and polishing its chrome.  All in all a great new toy that I can't wait to enjoy over the coming Summer months.
			<p />
			Life really does begin at 40.
