			<h2>Pine Wood Derby</h2>
			Monday 9th January 2004
			<p />
			Last year James joined the Tiger Cubs.
			<p />
			Tiger Cubs are basically 5 and 6 year old Boy Scouts.
			<p />
			The whole Scout experience is very different in the US to how I remember it in England as a boy.  Yes I know I was only a Cub for 4 weeks, and yes I know I was kicked out for digging a hole in the new Scout hut with my penknife.  But I experienced enough to realize things are different.
			<p />
			Firstly, the Scout movement here in the US is very family oriented.  Family members (Mums and Dads) are not so much encouraged to participate, as told.
			<p />
			James has den meetings every once a month den members house, where a parent must accompany the child - this is normally Lisa (actually it's always Lisa) as I usually have to work late those days.
			<p />
			Once a month all the dens get together for a mega meeting (usually held at James' school).
			<p />
			Then, every nmonth there is a field trip or activity the Cub (and parent) participates in.
			<p />
			This story is about one such activity.
			<p />
			The Pine Wood Derby has been annually run in the US since the Scout movement began.
			<p />
			Basically, each Cub comes home with a block of wood and is instructed to fashion the said wood into a car, which will then be raced at the Pine Wood Derby.
			<p />
			Now normally I don't get that involved in James' Cub stuff, but this was an opportunity to get out some power tools and destroy a piece of wood - how could I resist that!
			<p />
			We later found out that this is traditionally more for the fathers than the cubs and can get quite competitive between the Dad's over design, paint job, weight and speed. (Amazing I know that grown men would get so excited about this).
			<p />
			Anyway, my job was to beat all the other Dads - sorry I mean help James build a competitive car - no that's not it either ...  Oh yeah, spend some quality time with my son on a joint activity (that's better).
			<p />
			We agreed up front that I would design my, I mean his car, and he could paint it (under supervision).
			<p />
			So I got my tools out (also went to Home Depot to buy new tools) and cut up his wood.
			<p />
			James was given a paint brush and painted the car red, as he wanted it to look like a Ferrari.
			<p />
			We then attached the provided wheels using nails and waited for the weigh-in.  Yes there is a formal weigh-in...
			<p />
			This was when we started to realize how competitive this was.
			<p />
			All the Dads (and Cubs) turned up, tested their cars on a race track, named their cars and got their weight.
			<p />
			James had found 4000 stickers and decided to cover the car, I was not too keen on this as I felt it may effect the aerodynamics, but Lisa told me to shut up and let him have fun.
			<p />
			James decided to call his car 'The Sticker Car' (very imaginative - none of my suggestions were good enough).
			<p />
			When we weighed in we were 4lbs, a whole lb under the maximum weight.  Lisa said that's OK, but I felt it was unacceptable and decided to add some additional weight.
			<p />
			A table had been set up at the weigh-in that had drills, glue and lead piping (I jest you not) to add weight to the cars.
			<p />
			Dads were fighting for the best/straightest pipes to glue to their master pieces (some Dads just took this too far in my opinion - especially the big bearded git who stole my pipes - I mean I baggy'd them from across the table).
			<p />
			Anyway, after drilling 5 holes and packing them with lead piping we weighed in at 4.9lbs.  I was all for adding more but Lisa was loosing her patience by this time so we left the car (to prevent any post weigh-in tampering - very sensible in my opinion as some of the dads looked very dodgy).
			<p />
			I have to say though, some of the cars were amazing.  Apparently there are web sites you can go to, to down load kits to assemble the winning car!  Pathetic I call it, I mean it's supposed to be just Dad and son building a car and WHY DIDN'T ANYONE GIVE ME THE WEBSITE!!!!
			<p />
			Anyway, the following Monday we turned up for the actual race.
			<p />
			The race had multiple heats and race categories depending on the age of the Cub (what about the Dad's age that would have made more sense).
			<p />
			James' car went up against his den and other Tiger Cub dens and we did really well.  He won two races and came second in two.
			<p />
			Overall, he came fifth across all the Tiger Cubs and third in his den.  He also won an award for 'Best Use Of Stickers' (one of my better ideas I think).
			<p />
			This is a bit embarrassing but we forgot to take the camera to the race, so no pictures I'm afraid, but we took some great shots of my, sorry his, car when we got home and a nice one of James holding up his ribbons.
			<p />
			Next year we will visit the web site and do better.
