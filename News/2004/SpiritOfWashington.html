			<h2>Spirit Of Washington</h2>
			Saturday 7th February 2004
			<p />
			One Saturday morning Lisa and Linda decided the two families should go for a train ride.  The train in question was the Spirit of Washington that runs from Renton to Woodinville.
			<p />
			Linda invited Dustin, Jackie and Joshua to come along, but Dustin couldn't make it so Jackie and Joshua joined our convoy from Redmond to Renton.
			<p />
			I think at this time I should describe the city of Renton.  A work college of mine once described Renton as the "Arm Pit" of Seattle, that should say it all really, but Lisa and I have a Renton story to tell.
			<p />
			Lisa liked shopping in Asda in the UK.  Asda is owned by Wal-Mart in the US, so Lisa wanted to go to a Wal-Mart and see if they were similar.
			<p />
			She found the nearest Wal-Mart to be in Renton, so in Summer last year we went to check it out.
			<p />
			Renton (or at least the part of Renton Wal-Mart was in) was a little scary.  We suspected it wasn't a great part of town in the car park as we couldn't see one car (apart form ours) that was younger than 10 years old.  Virtually every car we saw had mismatched, replaced body parts (doors, wings etc) awaiting spraying and more dents than a car body shop, in fact I was scared to leave the car.
			<p />
			Once we arrived at the store entrance we were approached by a menacing group of teens demanding money for cookies, these teens were apparently disguised as Girl Guides.  I wanted to hand over money but Lisa was brave and we ran into the store.
			<p />
			This was a very large Wal-Mart that seemed to sell everything, at least everything that had fallen off the back of a lorry.  Needless to say Lisa was not impressed.  After making James and I walk up and down every aisle she led us out of the shop.  I was wonderfully surprised to find my car where I had left it and we left Renton never to return - or so I thought.
			<p />
			So back to the train trip...
			<p />
			The train station in Renton was just around the corner from Wal-Mart.  This filled me with joy and I was convinced I would never see the car again.  Fortunately we were in Lisa's car so I wasn't that bothered.
			<p />
			We found the station but couldn't find a parking place; we drove round the block a couple of times until we found a little car park right next to the station.
			<p />
			Once out of the car we met up with Linda, David, Jackie and the kids at the station (we had all parked in different places).  We went to collect our reserved tickets and encountered a problem.
			<p />
			When Linda and Lisa booked the seats they told the person on the telephone that there would be 5 adults and 5 children plus one infant who didn't need a seat.  Unfortunately this was misinterpreted to mean 9 tickets instead of 10.  As a result, Amaya didn't have a seat.  Luckily she is quite small so managed to sit between David and Linda.
			<p />
			Something cool about the train is that it's a dinner train and we all sat at tables for our meal.
			<p />
			The food was pretty good although not really appropriate for someone on a diet.
			<p />
			As a result, I swapped meals with Lisa as she had ordered be some sort of deep fried sandwich (good choice babe!).
			<p />
			The train set off and headed north.  I took some pictures as we went along; it was quite cool as you get a different perspective when viewing the world from a train.  We went past Lake Washington, and continued north to Woodinville.
			<p />
			When the train stopped we found ourselves at a winery.  They even provided a tour for the people on the train.  We decided not to take the tour but head instead straight to the shop to taste and purchase some wine.
			<p />
			As I'm not supposed to drink either, Lisa felt she should be primary tester.
			<p />
			After half an hour we purchased a couple of bottles of wine and headed back to the train.
			<p />
			The journey back to Renton was pretty uneventful.  James and Jacob played their game boys for the entire trip; I don't think they looked out of the window once.  Lisa looked after Abi and I played with Amaya and Joshua, making paper airplanes that we threw round the carriage.
			<p />
			What was quite cool was I walked to the next carriage, as it had an upstairs and glass ceiling.  This provided excellent views of the surrounding countryside.
			<p />
			So I took some more pictures.
			<p />
			Twenty minutes later we arrived back in Renton.  I was again happy to find our car in one piece and we headed home.
			<p />
			The train trip was great, with the added bonus of a winery at the other end.  The food was good too, so I would recommend it as a nice morning out should you get the chance.
