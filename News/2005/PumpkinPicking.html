			<h2>Pumpkin Picking</h2>
			Saturday 29th October 2005<br>
			<br>
			Halloween here in the US is a big deal.  I mean when I was a kid I used to trick or treat, but nothing like this.
			<p />
			Not only do kids go out and dress up, adults do too.
			<p />
			Then of course there are the Halloween parties (but that's a story for another day).
			<p />
			Anyway, getting in the festive spirit involves some effort.
			<p />
			For a starters there's the decorating of the house.  Some put up lights like Christmas (orange of course), others have scary skeletons and monsters hiding in the recesses of their porches, ready to jump out and scare shitless some poor unsuspecting dad - I mean child.
			<p />
			I on the other hand believe in moderation and tasteful d√©cor, which translates to - I may carve a couple of pumpkins for the kids (actually there is no may about it - Lisa makes me).
			<p />
			So we have to go and get our pumpkins.  Now, you can't just go down to Fred Meyer or QFC and buy a pumpkin - oh no that's just not done.  (Well actually it is done, they have thousands there and are at very low prices).  No no (sorry Lisa), what we have to do is go out and pick our own pumpkins ourselves.
			<p />
			I mean it matters not that the ones we pick are horribly deformed and rubbish for carving, or that they are astronomically priced three or four times the cost of a nice round pumpkin at Fred Meyer.  No, the point is spending a day out with the kids on a freezing October Saturday, having fun. (yeah that's right).
			<p />
			So, I hear you say, along with your friendly neighbors you hit the local pumpkin patch?
			<p />
			Well kind of.  Apparently, someone (Kathryn) knew of a great new place that was brilliant for picking pumpkins.
			<p />
			Firstly we couldn't find it, then when we did there were no pumpkins it was a park!  Nice one Kathryn.
			<p />
			Not to be perturbed, and no going home, no matter how much Lisa begged. (OK that may have been me). We went to the pumpkin patch everyone and his dog knew about in Woodinville.
			<p />
			Unfortunately, everyone and his dog went the day before and got all the nice round pumpkins, leaving all the deformed ones for us.
			<p />
			This didn't matter though as we were determined to buy at least three and have a good time.
			<p />
			So we all arrived at the Woodinville patch and unleashed the kids.
			<p />
			They had a fantastic time jumping on hay bales and stuff!
			<p />
			We then picked our pumpkins - I mean do they HAVE to charge that much for something that grows in the ground???  Plus the fact the farmer didn't have to pay a Mexican cash below the minimum wage to pick the pumpkin for him - Oh no I did that for free.
			<p />
			Sorry, going off on one about the price again.  And as Lisa quite correctly pointed out even the ones left could be carved and sort of looked round from one angle (from a thousand feet with your eye squinting).
			<p />
			Having purchased our lovely pumpkins, we all decided to go into the corn maze, which was apparently much better than last year.  Plus it only takes 10 minutes to walk round it and we were going home after that.
			<p />
			So we enter the maze.
			<p />
			90 minutes later (yes it took an hour and half) we exit and head for home.  It really was a very good BIG maze.
			<p />
			What a great day, can't wait till next year.
