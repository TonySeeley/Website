			<h2>Tummy Tuck! - End Story</h2>
			Friday 29th June 2007
			<p />
			So I was reading through some of my older stories on the web site (like you do) and realized I never finished the tummy tuck story.
			<p />
			Kind of left you hanging... Sorry about that, so I thought I would provide a final short update on the saga.
			<p />
			So we left the story last time with my tummy leaking puss and containing a wick gauze filter - nice.
			<p />
			The following week my original surgeon returned from vacation (Dr. Rand) and I went in to see him.
			<p />
			I seem to remember him saying something like "Oh you were unlucky there" or some other benile comment like that.  All I could think of was how I thought I was dying and how I would never go under the knife again.
			<p />
			I kept the gauze in for about a week and then Dr Rand removed it and the antibiotics had done their job, the infection was gone.
			<p />
			In quite a short time I was back in the gym and the swelling on my left side did go down a bit, but in reality only a bit.  I was definitely lopsided.
			<p />
			I discussed this with Dr Rand and he said (you are going to like this), "yeah that can happen, but stretching and exercise can make it go down - sometimes, and hey if not, I will just cut that bit off for you".
			<p />
			So I obviously hit the gym, in fact I hit the gym for 6 months, exercised regularly and had deep tissue massages on my side to break down the swollen tissue.
			<p />
			I tried everything, even falling off my motorcycle on the way home one day, but that just tore open the original incision which, when healed, was nearly half an inch wide where I had the accident!
			<p />
			Christmas was approaching and I decided to just get that out of the way before I made any big decisions, we also had a November vacation back the UK I wanted to get out of the way.
			<p />
			So the New Year finally rolled around and I went back to Dr. Rand.
			<p />
			We discussed my options, which included:
			<OL>
				<LI>Leave it</li>
				<LI>Have another operation under a general anesthetic</li>
				<LI>Have another operation under a local anesthetic</li>
			</OL>
			OK I can hear what you are thinking, why the hell would I chose to have a local rather than a general?
			<p />
			Well even though Dr Rand accepted some level of responsibility to fix my swollen side and no costs would be asked of me, he still needed to hire an anesthetist to knock me out - which was around $800.
			<p />
			Being me, I knew option 1 was not on, I wasn't prepared to spend the rest of my life changing in the gym standing with my left hand side next to the locker because I felt I looked stupid.  So it was a question of whether or not I was prepared to spend $800.
			<p />
			I wasn't.
			<p />
			Besides Dr Rand said "I will give you loads of shots and some valium, you won't feel a thing" (yeah I'm laughing now writing this - what was I thinking).
			<p />
			So February was set for the date of operation two and I went in to get carved up.
			<p />
			It was very weird, I'm lying there chatting to a nurse feeling Dr Rand rip (yes rip) the old scar tissue out.  Apparently that's the best way to do this.
			<p />
			He must have given me 200 injections all along the incision area which was from my tummy button right round my left side.
			<p />
			He cut out 2 inches or more of skin in width, and to answer you next question - yes it hurt - a lot in fact.
			<p />
			He gave me about 50 injections and started to cut, at which point I would say "I CAN FEEL THAT" quite loudly.
			<p />
			He would then say "Really, how odd" and give me 5 more injections.  This would then continue all the way round my side.
			<p />
			Possibly the worst part was smelling him cauterize blood vessels, I can't begin to tell you how much fun that bit was!
			<p />
			When he was finished he then spent 10 minutes sewing me up, by which time of course the anesthetic was starting to wear off.  So that was nice.
			<p />
			And then to add the final kicker, he stapled my side together.
			<p />
			I then got up and went home.
			<p />
			Over the next two weeks I went back for check-ups and to have the staples removed etc. and over time I healed up nicely.  In fact the second operation was a success and the swelling went and I was symmetrical.
			<p />
			They say of course that time makes you forget and I guess it's true as by the time I actually healed after operation two it had been a year since operation one, and for the first year after that I still said I regretted ever having the procedure.
			<p />
			Now it's been another year and I'm so pleased I went through with it.
			<p />
			I look back sometimes and see the before pictures and it's like wow - thank goodness I had the operation :-)
			<p />
			Even Lisa thinks it was worth it now and she saw all the aggravation and pain I went through.  And to show solidarity, she went had had a breast reduction and tummy tuck late last year, and she looks amazing.
			<p />
			Maybe one day she will write about that, but don't hold your breath :-)
