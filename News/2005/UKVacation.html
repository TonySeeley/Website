			<h2>UK Vacation</h2>
			Wednesday 16th - Tuesday 29th November 2005
			<p />
			So it had been just over two and a half years since Lisa had been back to England.  She was really missing friends and family, trashy magazines and TV and of course  fish and chips and Indian and Chinese takeaways.
			<p />
			As a result we decided to forgo our summer vacation and take the kids back to the UK for a couple of weeks.
			<p />
			Lisa's sister Nikki (and her family) very kindly offered to put us up and even lent us a car while we were visiting.
			<p />
			The problem was we wanted the trip to still be a vacation for the kids. Typically a trip to the UK would involve lots of visits to people's houses and loads of cups of tea.  Something that is fine with Lisa and me but really no fun for the kids.
			<p />
			So we made a plan to do the touristy thing and go to London and see the sights.  This we saw was a benefit for James too, who was really too young when he left to appreciate some of the culture and history he left behind.
			<p />
			I, of course at this time, sat back and let Lisa plan the trip.
			<p />
			The itinerary included trips on an open top bus in London, visits to the museums, Madame Tussauds and Cadbury World for Lisa to stock up on her depleting chocolate hoard.
			<p />
			To make the experience fun we invited family members to meet us on different days, thus killing two birds with one stone as it were.  Giving Lisa and I quality time with family while still giving the kids a good time.
			<p />
			In truth we just did too much to cover everything here in this news story, so I will restrict myself to some of the places we visited that have associated pictures.
			<p />
			Before I do that, I just want to say how great it was seeing everyone including family: My Dad and Chris and Sisters and Brother (and nieces and nephews of course), Jane, Gerry and Aimee, Alex, Katie, Neil, Charlie and Daisy, and Lisa's family too, Mum Janet, Nikki, Craig, Jordan and Regan, Tracy and Walter, Ria, Maddie and Jana.
			<p />
			Friends too, Dex, Jane and Sam, Karen, Georgia and Olivia, Sue, Nick, Alex, Christie and Ellie and David and Karen.  (I really hope I haven't missed everyone we had such a great time seeing you all again).
			<p />
			So here are the highlights :-)
			<p />
			Our first big day out was a bus tour round London with Kate, Neil, Charlie and Daisy.  It was a lovely day (a bit cold, but nice and sunny).  We met up at Trafalgar Square and jumped on an open top bus that just took us everywhere.  We drove round Trafalgar Square, Parliament Square and got some greats shots of Big Ben, and ended up crossing Tower Bridge and getting off at the Tower of London.  We had a great pub lunch and went into the Tower.  This was really cool, took loads of pictures and the kids had a great time.  We ended the day by catching another bus up to Leicester Square and walking up Regent Street to Hamleys toy shop, where the kids just went mental.
			<p />
			The next day it was back to London to Madame Tussauds with Kate and the kids which was hilarious. We got loads of pictures with our favorite stars.  The models looked, by the way, much better in real life than in the pictures.  We did get some funny looks though, or maybe that was just me, with my face on Kylie Minogue's bum and looking up Marilyn Monroe's dress and down Posh Spices' top :-)  Charlie and Daisy performed on stage too, to Simon Cowell and we again had a lot of fun.
			<p />
			After that we said our goodbyes to Kate, Charlie and Daisy and headed for Buckingham Palace.  Checked that out and got some photos and headed over to the London Eye.  For those who don't know, the London Eye is the world's largest Ferris Wheel.  It was a shame but the weather turned on us at this point and it started to rain, but we still had a great ride on the Wheel and saw some amazing sights of London.
			<p />
			The next trip was back to London this time with Nikki, Jordan and Regan to visit the Natural History and Science Museums.  This day started out as a bit of a disaster as England were playing rugby at Twickenham so driving though Twickenham to catch the tube to South Kensington was not a good idea.  This definitely proved to be true when we found out South Kensington tube station was closed and we had to leave the underground 2 miles from the museums.  By the time we got there (oh it was raining too) I just wanted to go home!  Lisa of course wouldn't let me so we visited The National Science Museum and the Natural History Museum, which the kids loved.  Luckily the trip home was a lot less painful and we arrived home safely but exhausted.
			<p />
			Then we went to Warwick for the day and stayed a night with Jane, Gerry and Aimee. We all went to a kids petting farm and met up with Tracey, Ria, Maddie and Jana.  The kids had a blast playing in the play grounds and seeing all the animals, that was a lot of fun.
			<p />
			The next day it was off to Cadbury World where we met Tracey again and Lisa found heaven.  She spend Â£120.00 on chocolate and chocolate related goodies, I couldn't believe it!
			<p />
			In truth the kids had a great time everywhere we went, both seeing new places and playing with cousins they haven't see in years.
			<p />
			Add to this a great day at my Dad's house (thanks Dad and Chris), and dinner out with Dex, Jane and Sam and then David and Karen.
			<p />
			Then of course there were the takeaways!!!!  Chinese at Jane and Gerry's, Chinese, Indian and Fish and Chips at Nikki and Craig's.
			<p />
			I actually put on 10 lbs on this holiday - too much fried food...
			<p />
			We really had a great time and it was lovely seeing everyone.  Once again thank you everyone who made time to give us a great vacation.
			<p />
			Next time though, you are all coming to us :-)
