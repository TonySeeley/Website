			<h2>New Year - Lake Chelan</h2>
			Friday 30th December 2005 - Monday 2nd January 2006
			<p />
			It's funny how scared we were when we moved to the States.  And how we got it all wrong!  Let me explain.
			<p />
			I always assumed work would be fine, in that I was in reality doing the same job I had been doing in the UK, so no nasty surprises there.  We were most worried about schooling, family culture and environment and making new friends!
			<p />
			The reason I say we got it all wrong is because the family culture of Washington State is wonderful, the air is clean and surroundings are beautiful.  The schools are unreal and we have made some wonderful new friends :-). Oh yeah and work sucks!
			<p />
			For instance; last year (New Year 2005) we went away with 3 other families to Lake Chelan in Western Washington.  We went for 3 days and had (probably) the best New Year of our lives.
			<p />
			So this year we decided - let's go again.
			<p />
			So off we set.  Unfortunately this time the Dennis' couldn't make it (David, Linda, Jacob and Amaya), but luckily the Gray's (James and Megan) and Dougherty's (Matt and Heather) could.  So this year it was just three families (which still meant a house full of kids - James, Abi, Connor, Austin, Sydney, Jordan, Katelyn and Megan).
			<p />
			James and Megan were to organizers and ironically booked a house three doors down from the place we stayed the year before.
			<p />
			Lake Chelan is just over four hours drive away over Stevens Pass (which was a little hairy due to the heavy snow fall), but we all arrived safely just as it got dark.
			<p />
			The house was just fantastic, really big (same as last year) with a big hot tub outside and a massive bonus room for the kids to play in.
			<p />
			We had the place for four days (three nights) and it was just amazing.
			<p />
			The general idea is we all play with the kids through the day and then put them down at around nine at night and then break out the booze.  In reality though, we drank pretty much through the day (but there was always someone sober and responsible - at least I think there was - during the day).
			<p />
			The evenings consisted of Texas Hold'em Poker and silly drinking games, which have the obvious effect of everyone getting drunk as skunks :-)
			<p />
			This years Lisa's Mum Janet was visiting for Christmas and New Year so she came along too.
			<p />
			One of the nice things about living in Washington State is the time zone.  Most Americans celebrate New Year by watching TV and seeing a large ball drop in Times Square in New York.  This, of course, is broadcast at nine at night on the west coast.
			<p />
			So the kids watch that, we tell them its New Year, lots of kisses and hugs etc. then they go to bed so we can enjoy ourselves at midnight - great eh?
			<p />
			So that's of course what we did, we even had fake Champagne for them to make it feel like a special occasion.
			<p />
			It was a great weekend and thanks to James and Megan for again organizing a wonderful getaway.
			<p />
			We made snowmen with the kids, sledded down some cool hills between fruit trees and generally had a blast.
			<p />
			Who said you can never recreate a great getaway - that's two years running and it just gets better.
			<p />
			We are already planning next years trip, only this time we will hopefully be able to go for longer.
			<p />
			And for David and Linda, <big><b>"WE HAD A REALLY NICE TIME"</b></big> :-)
