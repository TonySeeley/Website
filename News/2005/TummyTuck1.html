			<h2>Who wants a flat tummy?</h2>
			Thursday 2nd June 2005
			<p />
			For those in the know, last year I went on a health kick and lost some weight. 130 lbs to be precise (that's 9 stone 4 lbs for the Brits).  This was achieved by lots of exercise and sensible eating - not by cutting off both legs and arms as has been suggested.
			<p />
			Anyway this story isn't about me losing weight, I plan on writing a whole site on that in the future and yes I will include all the gruesome pictures.
			<p />
			No this is about what I did after losing the weight.
			<p />
			Now I know this is going to come as a complete surprise to some, but I am in fact 42 this year - yes, yes, I hear what you're saying, "But Tony you look like your in your early 30's".  Yes I know I am truly blessed :-), however, over 40 I am and that has consequences.
			<p />
			The biggest factor for me being skin elasticity.  When you're young your skin grows and shrinks without any issues.  When your old(er) it doesn't.
			<p />
			So when you carry 130 lbs too much for 10 years and then loose it, the body looks like a character out of Men in Black (i.e. some thin guy wearing a Tony suit).
			<p />
			"So what can you do about this?" I hear you ask.
			<p />
			Plastic Surgery.  Yes, go under the knife.
			<p />
			Some would say by even suggesting this I have totally adapted to life in the States, but I'm not sure this is necessarily true.
			<p />
			I carried quite a bit of investigation before making a decision, and read loads of testimonials off the internet both good and bad.  The bottom line is plastic surgery seems to have become more acceptable in recent years. (Just look at all the make over programs on the TV).
			<p />
			I spoke to the doctor at the health club I go to and he referred me to a surgeon in Bellevue (where Abi was born).
			<p />
			The surgeon I went to see (Dr. Rand) was described to me as the guy who is called in if someone else has buggered up your surgery.  He was Mr. Fix It and came with a price.
			<p />
			I again hit the Internet to check the guy out and he definitely came across as in the top 10 in the country.
			<p />
			So I made an appointment.  I should point out here that this all happened in Summer 2004.
			<p />
			Dr. Rand was great, really easy to talk to and not Dr. Frankenstein in any way at all.  He didn't even have an Egor!
			<p />
			After examining my Tony suit, he explained the "procedure" (that's what they call it) and the recovery time etc. and the lady (Rose) who takes the dosh gave me a quote.
			<p />
			$8,000.00 for about 2Â½ hours work.  I was clearly in the wrong business.
			<p />
			So I went home and discussed it all with Lisa.
			<p />
			I really wanted to pick the right time to have the operation, we were planning on a Hawaii holiday in November so I couldn't do it before then.  Then of course we entered Ski season and after last year (it was fantastic) I wasn't going to ruin that.  So this meant some time after the snow melted in April.
			<p />
			May, yes May made sense.
			<p />
			I called Dr. Rand and told him I would come back next year.
			<p />
			Well, Hawaii was fantastic, but no snow at home!  And I mean no snow at all.  So no skiing :-(.
			<p />
			Anyway May finally arrived and I booked in for my "procedure".
			<p />
			I went along to see Dr. Rand two weeks before the Big Day for my pre-op consultation.  This is basically a ruse to get you in the building and pay up before the surgery.
			<p />
			No big issues there at all, other than signing something that stated I accepted every kind of complication was not their fault and then handing over the $8000.00.
			<p />
			I have to say this is very strange, they give you a list of things that can go horribly wrong and you have to initial next to each, showing you read it.  Some were really gruesome too.  Like bloating up with fluid, no feeling sensation in your tummy ever again, really bad infections and my favourite, your tummy button may not be where you expected it to be! I did ask about that one stating it would be nice if I could have it on my shoulder for easier access, but nobody found it funny.
			<p />
			Before I describe the big day to you there are some things I want to point out.  Dr. Rand explained to me that after the procedure I would have to wear drains for a couple of weeks.  "Drains! What are Drains!" (Yes that's what I said too).  Well a drain is a plastic tube that comes out of your tummy (about 18 inches long) and is connected to a small egg shaped plastic bottle.  What you do is open the bottle, squeeze it and lock it shut.  Thus creating some suction in the bottle.  Then over time the bottle draws out any fluid from the tummy area.  And I had to have two of these for two weeks.
			<p />
			When I say the tummy area I should probably elaborate.  During the surgery they separate the skin from the muscle. After the operation this needs to reattach to complete the healing process.  Before it attaches there is a cavity.  Fluid collects in this cavity and needs to be drained - hence the tubes and bottles.
			<p />
			I also have to wear an elasticated corset for a month.  This pulls the skin tight against the muscle and speeds up the "re-attachment" process.
			<p />
			So got that? Two drains for two weeks and funny corset for a month.
			<p />
			So eventually along comes the big day.
			<p />
			Lisa took me to the hospital at 7:30 in the morning and everyone is waiting for me fully gowned and masked up - very cool - just like in ER :-).
			<p />
			I again signed a "You can kill me and I don't mind" disclaimer and changed into a green hospital gown.  Now I don't know about you but I never know which way to put those on.  For this procedure it was opening at the front.
			<p />
			They then ask me to sit down and tell me I have to wear these very unsexy white stockings for a week - which apparently prevent blood clots and death.  "Hang on a minute" you say, "you never mentioned anything about cross dressing before!" No I didn't I was a bit surprised myself!
			<p />
			So I put on the thigh high white stockings and I'm asked to stand up so Dr. Rand can draw on my tummy - cool - just like on telly :-)
			<p />
			After that it's show time so they walk me through to the operating theater.
			<p />
			Now while I was changing and putting on my stockings there was a couple of nurses and Dr. Rand around, in the operating theater there is a football team waiting.  All in green gowns and masks. (Starting to see where that $8000.00 goes?).
			<p />
			I have no idea who all these people where, for all I know they could be selling tickets and some are just spectators with a sick hobby!
			<p />
			So I lie on the bed and they attach these two arm rests that go out from the bed at 90 degrees.  So from above it looks like I'm being crucified. Now I did ask if there was any significance to this (again no laughing - not even a smile), all they said was "No" and "nobody has ever asked that before".
			<p />
			The anesthetist, then describes what he's going to do to me, give me injections, plug in an IV, stick a tube down my throat! Etc. etc.
			<p />
			Dr. Rand is chating away like its just another day at the office, while anesthetist bloke sticks me. I have to say at this point it didn't hurt, I did even know until he said OK that's done.  He was Gooooood :-)
			<p />
			And that is about all I remember.
			<p />
			My next memory is I'm waking up fully dressed (yes they even got me dressed) sitting up in a chair.  With a nurse explaining everything went really well and Lisa was on her way.  Yes you go home the same day.
			<p />
			All I could think of was, "Wow that was easy".  The best bit was I was in no pain at all.  I wasn't even in any discomfort.  I felt great - Valium I was told was an absolutely fantastic discovery - and I believed them.
			<p />
			I was given some pain killers (just in case) and some antibiotics, which I had to take four times a day until the drains came out so I wouldn't get an infection.
			<p />
			So Lisa comes and gets me and I go home.
			<p />
			OK, I was walking like some old geezer who had just pooed his pants, but big deal, it didn't hurt.
			<p />
			We get home and I go straight to bed.
			<p />
			The next couple of days were spent pretty much just lazing around watching DVD's and general TV or just reading - now this may seem like fun to most, but I was going completely stir crazy.
			<p />
			We (Lisa, her mum Janet and I) all wanted to look at the scar and my new tummy button (I was quite keen to see where it ended up), but I was too scared to remove the corset thingy before getting the OK by the Dr.
			<p />
			Now even though we hadn't looked properly we did take a little look at the scar and I was amazed to see I was stapled up all the way along.  It looked like I had been in some kind of weird Office World fight with a staple gun and come off worse.
			<p />
			I should also point out I had only taken pain killers a couple times, and that in truth was nothing to do with being in pain, I just figured at the time the last ones are probably wearing off I should re-top up.  I did this for a couple of days and then stopped and never had an issue.
			<p />
			We also had to empty the drain bottles each day and measure how much came out.  This is not as bad as it seams as the bottles have lines on them showing how full they are.  And at first is was just very red (blood almost) liquid coming out.  We had to do this in the first week around 3 or 4 times a day.
			<p />
			The operation was on a Monday, on the Friday I had to go back in to see Dr. Rand.
			<p />
			So there I am back in his consulting room all gowned up again with Lisa sitting by, when in comes Dr. Rand and one of his nurses both carrying pliers.
			<p />
			Now you can imagine how this could look and I think I said some expletive asked them what they were going with that!
			<p />
			"Don't worry Tony", says Dr. Rand, "This wont hurt at all".
			<p />
			They removed my corset and I get the first look at my new tummy.
			<p />
			First thoughts...
			<ol>
				<li>Wow that's flat</li>
				<li>Crap my tummy button is where it used to be</li>
				<li>Yuk its all scabby and horrid</li>
				<li>What's that awful smell</li>
			</ol>
			Yes it was flat, and yes the tummy button was perfectly positioned where it was supposed to be.  It was also quite scabby and the horrid smell was me.  I had not had a bath or shower for a week.
			<p />
			I would like to point at here that I do normally have a high level of personal hygiene, but had been told by Dr. Rand no showers or baths until after Friday.
			<p />
			Dr. Rand and Nurse Pain, then start pulling out the staples with the pliers.
			<p />
			Around 40 I would guess.  And you know he was right, it never hurt at all.
			<p />
			I asked if it was all healed now and he said not, the internal sutures were holding me together and if he pulled hard he could probably re-open the incision.  I pointed out I totally believed him and a demonstration of his cleverness was not necessary.  (These guys never laugh at my jokes, this was starting to annoy me).
			<p />
			So Dr. Rand puts the corset back on me and tells me I'm doing fine and tonight I can have a shower after wrapping myself in saran-wrap so no water gets into my tummy through the drain openings.
			<p />
			So Lisa and I head home excited about the flatness of my tummy and positioning of its button, but most of all, the opportunity to shower.
			<p />
			Now I know some people "like" to play with saran-wrap.  All I can say is I'm NOT one of them.  Apart from feeling and looking like an idiot (something that normally doesn't bother me), it really doesn't feel that nice.  I, of course, use the world "feel" in its loosest sense as I couldn't feel that much at the moment as my tummy was still numb from the operation.  When I asked about this I was told that it normally takes 6 months for the full feeling sensation to return (if it fully returns at all).  "Hang on isn't that new information too?" You ask.  Yup - didn't tell me that one.
			<p />
			So there we are in our bathroom, Lisa and I, wrapping me up in preparation to shower.
			<p />
			The tubes obviously have to stay in with the bottles attached so you have to kind of wrap those up too.
			<p />
			I have to say I looked quite freaky getting into the shower, but my god it felt good.  So good in fact I didn't want to get out.
			<p />
			Lisa had to wash my legs as I couldn't bend down, but apart from that I washed everything else (mind out of the gutter please I have just had an operation)!
			<p />
			After the shower I felt clean and so much better.  I got used to the drains quite quickly and they really weren't an issue, apart from the fact that as I healed the liquid coming out started to clear and include chucks of flesh and blood clots - yuk.
			<p />
			I kind of went back to work a little early though, I returned one week after the op.  My drainage didn't seem to be going down so after a couple of days I worked from home for the rest of the week.
			<p />
			So, where am I now?  How does it feel to lose the drains? And what does it look like?
			<p />
			All good questions, to which the answers are:
			<p />
			Same place, don't know and the same.
			<p />
			At the time of writing it's been 3Â½ weeks since the operation and I still have the drains in.  Dr. Rand wont remove them until I drain 30cc or less in 24 hours from each bottle.  The last 24 hours were 80cc in each.
			<p />
			When I phone Dr. Rand up I always get a nurse who starts with "Oh don't worry you are doing sooo well" (like she knows how I'm doing!).
			<p />
			And "Not long now!", not sure what that means.  I mean she has seen me naked!
			<p />
			I asked them last Monday (my 3 week point) when should I start to worry about the drains.  They told me don't worry.  So I asked what's the longest a patient has had the drains in?  To which I was told 4 weeks.  I was also told the people who lose a lot of weight usually take longer then 2 weeks to stop draining.  Well hang on, they never told me that one either.
			<p />
			I did ask if I should start worrying next Monday then (4 week point), they just said "no".
			<p />
			There are a couple of reasons I'm writing this story now, one is I think it's quite funny, and the other is I'm a bit pissed off and think by getting this down it may help my state of mind (hasn't yet).
			<p />
			Anyway I will publish another update when (or should I say if) the drains come out and I lose the corset.  I will include in that story some before and after pictures.  So make sure you're not eating when you read it.
			<p />
			So, I'm off to empty some bottles.
