			<h2>Tummy Tuck! - Are you mad?</h2>
			Sunday 26th June 2005
			<p />
			OK so lets recap...
			<p />
			When I last left you I was drained up with the two plastic bottles and tubes and had been that way for almost 4 weeks.
			<p />
			Remember the Doctor told me it would be two.
			<p />
			I have to say the day I wrote the last update I was pretty low and depressed, I mean it's a real pain having to empty those little bottles all the time and every now and then you catch a tube and scare yourself to death!
			<p />
			Suffice to say I was not in high spirits.
			<p />
			So you can imagine my surprise when the morning after I posted the first tummy tuck story, Friday 3rd June, I got a call from Dr. Rand's surgery.
			<p />
			His nurse Tammy was calling me up to say they wanted me to come in to have my drains removed.
			<p />
			My immediate reaction was "What!, But you said it had to go down to 30cc or less in each bottle!"
			<p />
			"Yes we know" said Tammy, "But it's obviously not going to, so we thought we would try something else.  Come in and we can tell you about it."
			<p />
			I was elated, really surprised, was this the moment when normality would return?
			<p />
			So later that day I went into the surgery.
			<p />
			I had to sit in a special chair that then lowered down into a bed.  Dr. Rand came in and told me his plan.
			<p />
			As I wasn't draining completely and had basically leveled off, he wanted to change the drain type to what he described as a gauze drain.
			<p />
			He said that the best way forward was to remove the two tube drains I currently had in, and enjoy my weekend.  "Who knows" he said, "maybe you'll be lucky and you'll be OK on Monday".  Yeah right!
			<p />
			"However there is the chance you will continue to build up fluid and if this happens your tummy will resemble a water bed.  Press it in on the left and watch the waves wash around the front to the right!"  Sounded great.
			<p />
			If this happened I was to come in on Monday and they would fit the gauze drain.  This involved inserting a rubberish hose into my tummy, about 4 inches inside about Â½ inch outside and slapping a piece of gauze over the top.
			<p />
			I would then just need to change the gauze whenever it got full!
			<p />
			Starting to sound even better!
			<p />
			Oh yeah he also said a great alternative to gauze (which is quite expensive) is a babies diaper.
			<p />
			"What the hell", I said, "I'm game, lets do it."  I was of course delirious and convinced I wouldn't be waterbed man on Monday so the gauze drain wouldn't be necessary.  What a fool.
			<p />
			So then Dr. Rand starts to explain how the tubes I have in are removed.
			<p />
			"Well Tony your body will have made the tubes swell up a little on the inside, this is perfectly normal.  Unfortunately when we pull them out the are a little bigger than the hole and it can be a little uncomfortable."
			<p />
			So he cuts the stitch holding the first tube in and starts to pull.  This was wasn't too bad, it definitely felt like he was pulling something too big out of a tiny hole, but it didn't hurt that much. There was a horrid popping sound the tube came out.
			<p />
			The second tube however hurt like hell and I think I may have even swore at some point.  It throbbed after too which was horrid.
			<p />
			So Tammy and the Doctor placed small pieces of gauze over each hole and told me to go home and enjoy my weekend.
			<p />
			It was actually around 1pm so I had to go back to work, but unfortunately I had fluid running down my legs.  As a result I worked from home for the rest of the day.
			<p />
			By Saturday morning the holes had stopped draining so I didn't have to gauze up anymore.
			<p />
			I did however have to keep on my corset over the weekend, so I wasn't completely free.  The best bit was the shower I had when I go home on Friday, no saran-rap it was wonderful.
			<p />
			Unfortunately, by Sunday night my tummy was quite swollen and I had become waterbed man.  It was hysterical, just like watching waves, quit freaky actually.
			<p />
			So Monday morning came and I was resigned to get my new drain.
			<p />
			I have to say I was quite looking forward to it too as I was starting to get uncomfortably tight around the middle.  Thank goodness they said Monday eh?
			<p />
			So I phoned them up on Monday and got through to Tammy who said, "Sorry we are a little busy today how about tomorrow at midday?".  I really am the luckiest guy don't you think?
			<p />
			So Tuesday came around and I am now really tight and quite pissed off (again), and sloshing around like I have four or five water balloons up my jumper.
			<p />
			When I arrived at the surgery, I had to go into the operating room, this was obviously serious stuff.
			<p />
			They kindly put up a screen (like they do for mothers having a caesarian), they clearly didn't want me to watch.  This was OK as I didn't want to watch either.
			<p />
			However, they then put one of those great big operating theater lights above which reflects everything they are doing over the screen.  It was just like watching it through a mirror.  And I couldn't help but watch!!!!
			<p />
			Dr. Rand gave me a local anesthetic, which in truth was completely unnecessary as I was still completely numb and couldn't feel a thing.
			<p />
			He then cut a new hole, about 3 inches below my tummy button and pushed in a 5 inch rubber hose.
			<p />
			He then put in a couple of stitches and that was it.
			<p />
			He did say at this point "Two weeks Tony, nobody every needs a gauze drain more than two weeks".  Ha, I felt a challenge coming on!
			<p />
			They put two large gauzes and a small green theater towel on top, taped me up and sent me home.
			<p />
			What can I say about the next two weeks?  It was definitely easier with the gauze drain, I could wear normal clothes again (the last 4 weeks I had lived in sweat pants and it was good to put jeans on again).
			<p />
			I could even shower without saran-rap, at first I felt a little conscious of my tube and would cover it up, but after a week, I just stopped caring.  I was always careful not to direct any shower water into the tube, but other than that I kind of forgot about it.
			<p />
			The first few days I used loads of gauze.  Then I turned to Abi's Huggie diapers.
			<p />
			At work people would ask me who I was today, referring to the picture on the diaper.  I was usually either Big Bird or Elmo, as these are Abi's favourite.
			<p />
			I had found after week one that if I took the gauze and diaper off and pressed my tummy, I could make the fluid squirt out of my tube.  I would spend 5 minutes before every shower doing this.
			<p />
			I did this for two reasons.  Firstly I was supposed to always be empty thus helping the body to heal, so getting fluid out was a good thing.  Secondly, it was quite good fun, seeing how much I could get out.
			<p />
			It was definitely working though, as over the two weeks the amount dropped considerably.
			<p />
			Anyway, two weeks seemed to come and go quite quickly, but I was still draining fluid.
			<p />
			My tummy however was feeling different.  It was starting to go hard on the right hand side and I was getting feeling back.  Both symptoms of me getting better.
			<p />
			So two weeks after the drains go in Tammy the nurse calls me up.  "Tony, do you want to come in and have the drain removed?".  I mean, what a daft question?  However I found myself saying, "But I'm still draining", "OK Said Tammy give us a call when you stop!"
			<p />
			And that was it she hung up.  What happened to nobody grains more than 2 weeks?  There was no surprise in her voice at all!
			<p />
			So you can imagine by now I'm not too happy, have been draining 6 weeks and am still juiced up!
			<p />
			Over the next few days though things changed rapidly. My left side started to go hard too and I was starting to get feeling back across all of my tummy.
			<p />
			I was also draining a lot less.
			<p />
			So Friday came around, I had had the drains in for two and a half weeks and decided I would go the weekend and ask for them to be taken out on Monday.
			<p />
			I telephoned the surgery but was told they were all on holiday next week, so it was today or 9 days time.
			<p />
			OK here is mistake number two on my part (mistake one was obviously having the operation in the beginning), mistake two was hearing myself say, "Great I'll be in at 1pm".
			<p />
			So I go into the surgery at 1pm and see Dr. Rand.  He looked at my dressing and stated that even though I was draining a little more than he expected he could take out the drain.  I'll give him his due however, he did ask me if I wasted to keep it for 9 more days.
			<p />
			I think the thought of losing the drain AND the corset was just too much.
			<p />
			"Nope, take it out please", again it was like hearing someone else. And without doubt mistake number 3.
			<p />
			"What's the big deal?" you ask, "All that can go wrong is you fill up with water again surely?"  Ha I wish.
			<p />
			No, what can go wrong at this stage is you can get a very bad infection.
			<p />
			Guess what happened to me?
			<p />
			Friday night was a nightmare.  I had a temperature of 103 and hot and cold shakes.  I really thought I was dying.  On top of that my left side was incredibly sore and was starting to go red and swell.  This surely wasn't good!
			<p />
			Lisa was amazing and really looked after me. She kept me topped up with medication that lowered my temperature.  I remember waking up at 3am Saturday morning soaking wet, and I mean soaking like I had just got out of the bath.
			<p />
			And to top it all my Surgeon and his entire staff are on holiday for the next 9 days.
			<p />
			That didn't stop Lisa mind you, she telephoned the surgery and got hold of a covering Doctor when was looking after Dr. Rand's patients while he was away.
			<p />
			She spoke to him Friday night and said as long as my temperature went down I was OK, and we should call him in the morning for an update.
			<p />
			Saturday morning I was feeling a lot better, my side felt worse, but the fever had gone and my temperature was normal.
			<p />
			He actually phoned us to ask how I was doing.  I told him the score and he said If I felt bad again Saturday night he wanted to see me Sunday, if not he would see me Monday morning.
			<p />
			So Saturday night comes around and I'm feeling OK till around 7pm, then in the next hour I start to go downhill rapidly.  Shaking starts at first and the my temperature goes up.
			<p />
			By 8pm I'm feeling pretty bad again.
			<p />
			We were actually at a friends house playing poker (everyone else is drinking, while I'm on water and shaking away).
			<p />
			Lisa took me home and I went to bed.
			<p />
			That night my temperature went up to 104.
			<p />
			Sunday morning we called Dr. Leff (the cover Doctor) and we agreed to meet him at his surgery at 12 noon.
			<p />
			We all pilled in the car and got there on time, I'm feeling pretty bad by then and my left side is redder than ever and very swollen.
			<p />
			Dr Leff, who was really nice (I just kept apologizing for being such a pain over his weekend), got a cotton bud and basically stuck it into my tummy where the gauze drain had been.  This had healed up on Friday in no time at all and was not draining anything.
			<p />
			I didn't feel a thing but when he pulled out the cotton bud it was followed by a flood of the most vile thick yellow liquid I had ever seen.
			<p />
			I smelt terrible and just kept coming.
			<p />
			He inserted into the hole a piece of gauze that would stop the hole from healing up and act as a wick to drain out all the infected fluid (I think another name for it would be puss).
			<p />
			He told me to keep a heated towel on my left side and to come back and see him tomorrow (which would be Monday).
			<p />
			Once I started draining I felt better.  I don't know how long this will take to get better and in truth have no idea how long it will be before I can put this entire saga behind me.
			<p />
			I kind of expected that the tummy tuck would take two publications to completely tell on the web site, clearly I was very wrong.
			<p />
			So I'll leave you here, and go off and drain some more.
