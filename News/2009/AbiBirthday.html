			<h2>Abi's Birthday</h2>
			Wednesday 6th May 2009
			<p />
			This year Abi turned 6 years old and, as is the tradition for young ladies, she wanted a party for all her friends to celebrate the day.
			<p />
			As I'm sure you can imagine, the idea of twenty six year olds running around the house is just terrifying. Luckily there are a number of venues you can take the kid's where they can let of steam and not destroy your house.
			<p />
			What typically happens is one child finds a new place to have a party and invites all her/his friends. Then every kid who attended wants their party at the same place. This does unfortunately mean, as a parent, you have to go to the same place twenty times in the year.
			<p />
			I guess this isn't too bad until you run out of new venues and have to go back to the ones you did two years ago! Luckily kids that age only have very short term memories. Also, luckily, as they get older they get too cool to go to such parties (James is well past that stage), Abi however still has a few more birthdays left in her.
			<p />
			So this year is was back to 321 Bounce. This is basically a big warehouse with loads of bouncy castles and slides in it.
			<p />
			The "party" starts with the people who run the place laughingly making the party goers sit through a safety video. Obviously nobody watches this, but I can almost see the letter coming from the management's attorney explaining to me why it's my fault my daughter broke her leg and not theirs - and of course they told her not to jump off the highest castle in the video!
			<p />
			Anyway the kids take their shoes off and go mental for 40 minutes. There is usually a casualty somewhere along the way (this year that was Sydney Gray - hurt her leg) and someone gets left out "of the gang" and cries for a bit (can't remember who that was)!
			<p />
			What is sometimes funny though is watching the parents getting a crafty slide or bounce when they think nobody is watching. I of course am ALWAYS watching, mums you have been warned!
			<p />
			The kids get horribly sweaty and totally exhausted, but to keep them pumped up we then feed them fizzy drinks, pizza and cake - so they get lots of sugar for when the parents come and get them.
			<p />
			After the food the kids all give the birthday girl her presents and we have to frantically try to remember who gave what so we can say thank you later.
			<p />
			As expected Abi had a great time. Unfortunately this party was on a school day in the afternoon/early evening so she was also wasted after and we had to get her home to bed.
			<p />
			On the negative side it's a pretty quick $300, and the positive being my house is still in one piece.
			<p />
			I can't wait till she is cool...
