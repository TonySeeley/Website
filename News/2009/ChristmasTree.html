			<h2>Christmas Tree Shopping</h2>
			Sunday 6th December 2009
			<p />
			We don't have many traditions in our family, but a few years ago we decided we wanted a real Christmas tree in the house over the holidays.  As a result, the first weekend of December the family wraps up warm and heads out to Carnation or North Bend to get our tree.
			<p />
			Last weekend we were busy so we decided to go this week.  We had a lot to do as well, as the house lights needed to go up outside.  One rule we do have is we don't decorate or celebrate anything Christmassy until after Lisa's birthday.  Now that was out of the way we had to get cracking.
			<p />
			Normally I do the lights myself, but it's a horrid job on your own.  Don't get me wrong, I actually like putting the lights up - the bit I hate is untangling the lights from the mess I left them in last year and fixing all those blown bulbs.   We have about 3,000 bulbs on the house so this can take a while.  As I have been complaining about this Lisa decided everyone would help.  James and her would unstring the lights, I would hang them and Abi would watch and dance around the garage!
			<p />
			So Saturday morning saw us all outside in the cold, unraveling the lights.  In all it took about 4 hours, but the end result looks great.  I tend not to use a ladder and instead just climb outside an upstairs window and walk over the roof, then just lean over the edge and hang the lights.  I don't mind heights but Lisa doesn't like me doing this.   The problem this year was the roof was pretty icy and very slippery.  Still I managed to get the lights up without any nasty accidents.  Ironically, while I was sitting on the very top of the house a neighbor walked by and told me he paid his Mexican "handyman" dude $80 to hang his!  Of course he shared this piece of information as I was hanging the last strand!  So next year I may get his man in!
			<p />
			After the outside lights were up, we needed to get the tree.  So Sunday morning we all wrapped up warm and jumped into Lisa's car.  Last year we found a place in Carnation so decided to go back there.  In the past we went all the way to North Bend (in the foothills of the Cascades).  It's very pretty in North Bend, but you usually have to fight snow, and it's a good hour away whereas Carnation is only 15 minutes away.  This time we also decided to take Roxie with us.
			<p />
			The farm that grows and sells the trees is amazing. You pull up in the car and they give you a map, and a big saw.  The map tells you where the different types of trees are growing and they have pictures of each tree on the wall.  They had all types of trees; Douglas, Noble, Grand, Norway Spruce so you can always find one that fits your personal taste, both in shape and height.  In the past we have gone for Noble Firs but this year we thought we would get a Grand.
			<p />
			We headed off to the Grand Fir area where they had loads of beautiful trees.  Eventually we found one, and I hit the floor to cut it down.  Under the tree however the needles looked a little brown so we decided we needed a different tree.  Finally we found the perfect tree, about 12 feet tall, thick and bushy (no bad gaps or holes in its branches).
			<p />
			It took ages to cut down, and Lisa and I both had a go.  James wasn't interested because it would have meant that he would have got dirty on the floor, and may have broken a sweat (two things that are uncool - I mean you never know when a foxy chick will walk past!).
			<p />
			When the tree was cut down it fell on Lisa (well done James for capturing the picture) and after we all stopped laughing we helped her up and carried the tree to the baling and paying station.
			<p />
			The people there put your tree on a "tree shaker" (that's the only name for it) which shakes all the dead pine needles off the tree, along with any leaves and chipmunks etc :-)
			<p />
			Then they cut a nice smooth bottom to the tree (something I didn't do the first time we got a tree - we found that once the tree was upright and decorated it wasn't straight), and finally they bale the tree in a large fish net stocking for transport.
			<p />
			Lisa then went and got the car while Abi and I watched the tree then when she got back I loaded it on the car and strapped it down.  Once we got home we got the tree inside, and finished the decorating.
			<p />
			We actually have two trees, one in what Lisa calls the "Quiet Room" (this is the real one), and one in the family room.  The family room tree is the fake one that has all the presents underneath Christmas day.  The kid's stockings are by the real tree and this is where Father Christmas leaves his gifts (what can I tell you, the fat guy in red isn't getting the credit for the big stuff - not in my house anyway).
			<p />
			Sunday night saw the family all exhausted and two new trees in the house.  On a positive side for Roxie, Lisa always puts two red tree skirts on the floor under the trees and Roxie loves to pee on them - so that's good!
			<p />
			Now we just need to wait till Christmas Day to get our hands on all the lovely prezzies.
			<p />
			Merry Christmas
