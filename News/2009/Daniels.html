			<h2>Dinner At Daniels</h2>
			Saturday 28th February 2009
			<p />
			In the last year James has become much more adventurous with his food. In the past whenever we ate out, all he would have was spagetti, chicken tenders and maybe, if he was feeling very daring, a burger with nothing on it (just the burger).
			<p />
			Whenever we offered him something new to try he would just turn his nose up and refuse. Abi on the other hand has a different approach. She picks what she wants off the menu and it's always the same thing spagetti (or some other form of pasta) or chicken tenders - and then when our food comes she eats that! This drives me nuts by the way!
			<p />
			But like I said James has "changed" (in more ways than I can cover here). He now likes spicy food and is much more willing to try new things. He also discovered late last year that he like steak. Lisa and I kept telling him that we would one day take him to a really nice restaurant so he could try something really good, and the time finally came around.
			<p />
			We decided to take James and Abi to Daniels in Bellevue. This is a really nice steak house, pretty expensive (not the sort of place we go to very often) and located on the 21st floor of a building overlooking Lake Washington.
			<p />
			So off we went. I ordered my normal favorite, medium rare Filet Mignon, garlic mash and creamed spinach (yeah I know, I'll start the diet tomorrow). Lisa had something burnt to a crisp (again with the garlic mash). Abi had Teriyaki steak strips and mash, and James had a medium Filet Mignon.
			<p />
			Like I said, this is an expensive place and it was a gamble whether the kids would like and appreciate the food. Unfortunately they loved it!
			<p />
			We had a really nice meal. James and Abi really behaved themselves in the place too (another potential concern) and we all got to see the sun set over the lake.
			<p />
			We finished up with some great deserts and left feeling very full.
