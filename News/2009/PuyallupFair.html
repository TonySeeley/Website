			<h2>Puyallup Fair</h2>
			Sunday 27th September 2009
			<p />
			For those that don't know (UK readers), state and country fairs are a big deal in the US.   Historically they were centered around farming communities and were used to show and sell live stock and crops that were raised and grown over the Summer.
			<p />
			These fairs were big on holding competitions for large produce or healthy live stock and even today they hold competitions for local farmers.
			<p />
			One of the largest fairs in Washington state is the Puyallup Fair which is held each year in the last two weeks in September and has been running for for over 100 years.  Originally it was just called the Valley Fair and targeted towards local farmers and manufactures in the Puyallup area.  But now it's a huge event with loads of attractions.
			<p />
			We don't go that often as I always feel I lose IQ points visiting a state fair, but this year Lisa wanted to go as they had a stage performance of High School Musical :-(  Abi was obviously very excited about this, James and I, not so much.
			<p />
			Lisa chose the day (the last day of the fair) and asked Kathryn and Cameron if they wanted to go too.  Kathryn said yes and we all got ready to go to the fair.
			<p />
			I'm sure you can all appreciate that it's impossible to go to a state fair without getting coffee first, so we all agreed to meet at Sorrento's (Lisa's local coffee haunt) first.  Once we were "coffee'd up" we headed off to Puyallup (which is about an hour away).  
			<p />
			The day we chose was one of the last really sunny days of the summer and it was really beautiful out.  On the way we had a great view of Mount Rainier and arrived amazingly at the same time as Kathryn, Cameron, Danielle, Quinton and Valerie.  Danielle also brought her boyfriend, although he doesn't speak much - at least when I'm around!
			<p />
			We entered the fair and started checking things out.  The fair is really big and we gave the kids all the normal rules around getting lost etc., although based on the look of the other people at the fair if we lost the kids we were never going to see them again.
			<p />
			I know there are some big people in the states but my god there were some monsters at the fair and the average number or teeth per person worked out to be about 10!  I'm sure you get the idea.
			<p />
			The fair had all the usual stuff, food cooked in fat, weird looking meat (I swear I saw someone walking around chewing on a pig's leg), rides that turn your stomach inside out, petting areas where you can stroke a cow, they even have sheep rodeo for small children (yes really).
			<p />
			The first thing we did was to find the show time for the High School Musical performance.  It turned out that this was a two and a half hour show (god knows why -  the film is only 90 minutes long) and thank god Lisa decided it was too long for the kids (so that wasn't happening).  Then we went looking for rides.  
			<p />
			The problem with the rides was that they were either completely lame or gut wrenchingly terrifying.  Also to get on a ride you have to buy tickets.  This is really quite a cleaver idea as if you actually realized how much you were paying to get on a roller-coaster you would run away screaming.  As it is you fork out around $100 on tickets and then "enjoy" 5 rides!
			<p />
			We went and saw a 3D show on "the brain", met up with another family (friends of Kathryn and Cameron) and ate some very healthy food (not).  The kids wanted fries and we brought a rectangular brick of fries dripping in fat - apparently they tasted really nice.
			<p />
			After going on a few rides, some good, some not so good and getting an ice cream, we decided we needed to leave.  We were concerned we would go completely "red neck" and start chewing on tobacco.
			<p />
			Running for the car poor Valerie fell and hurt her leg, but we just picked her up and ran before the locals smelt the blood!
			<p />
			I think we will give next year a miss.
