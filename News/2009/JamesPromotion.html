			<h2>James' School Promotion</h2>
			Thursday 18th June 2009
			<p />
			It's hard to believe that we have been in the US now for nearly 7 years. I guess the biggest reminder of this for me is seeing how big James is. He is now taller than Lisa, his voice has broken, he has a friend who is a girl (I'm not allowed to call her his girl friend) and has gone all cool on me.
			<p />
			When we moved here he was in Kindergarten, and then did the whole elementary school thing. This takes 7 years in total, and then I find myself attending his school promotion! So all you English readers are probably wondering what a Promotion is. Well here in the States they save the word "graduation" for when you leave High School. Every other school you leave is a promotion!
			<p />
			States across the US are different (and some school districts are different too) but here in our Washington State school district, kids go to elementary school from K through 6 (that means Kindergarten and then from 1st grade through to 6th grade). After that they are promoted to middle school (or Junior High). Then it's 3 more years from 7th grade to 9th, followed by another promotion to High School where they spend their last three years of state school education from 10th to 12th grade when they graduate at the age of 18.
			<p />
			Another thing I learnt recently is that you aren't allowed to call someone in their first year of Junior High a "Freshman", apparently the terms Freshman, Sophomore and Senior are also reserved for High School (and College that has 4 years so they add Junior before Sophomore and Senior - weird I know). James who is now in 7th grade is known as a "Sevy".
			<p />
			OK so back to Promotion.
			<p />
			This was his official, "you are leaving Elementary school" event. The kids all get dressed up (well I say all, some don't bother, and some turn up in ball gowns and suits). There is a formal event run by the school principal to say goodbye and good luck. It's actually really nice. Parents and family are invited to attend and sit at the back. The kids come in to music playing and the principal says a few words. Then the 6th grade classes (in James' year this year, there were two) get up and perform for the audience. This was hysterical as they sang "All Star" by "Smash Mouth" (you probably know this as the song from Shrek "Hey now, you're an all star..."). This was funny for two primary reasons. Firstly the music teacher stood at the front and conducted the kids singing while she danced around (how I didn't laugh out loud I will never know) and then I noted every kid on stage was singing except one - James. He looked totally pissed off! Anyway I thought it was great.
			<p />
			After that the kids are called forward one by one and get a "you're leaving" certificate and get the shake the principal's hand. Then they file out to music again.
			<p />
			It was really nice. After the event the kids get to take some pictures with their teachers, friends and class mates to capture some memories and then leave for home.
			<p />
			James was pretty miserable throughout the whole ordeal but I liked it (and as you know it's always all about me, so I think it was a great success).
			<p />
			Now he is in Junior High carrying more bags to school than I ever remember. Poor guy has his school bag that is filled with binders and weighs a ton, his lunch box that won't fit in the bag, his sports kit (he plays basketball every day after school) and his guitar Ð yes, one of his lessons is guitar! He is supposed to get on a bus with all this stuff everyday, but I feel guilty, so usually (most days) drive him to school.
			<p />
			So the next promotion is in 3 years time, so he can relax for a while and enjoy the peace and quiet :-)
