			<h2>Cannon Beach</h2>
			Saturday 5th - Monday 7th September 2009
			<p />
			For some time now people have been telling us about Cannon Beach. Lisa, as a result, has been badgering me (sorry that's the only word) to visit. So I hear you ask "what is Cannon Beach" and "why would you want to go?"
			<p />
			Cannon Beach is obviously a beach, about 4 hours drive from us on the Pacific coast in Oregon.
			<p />
			Those of you who have seen "The Goonies" film may remember the beach at the end of the film with the pirate ship sailing out to sea. That's Cannon Beach.
			<p />
			Another draw to justify a visit is that the place is supposed to be very dog friendly, so it's an ideal place to visit with Roxie.
			<p />
			So Lisa found us a hotel and arranged for a 3 day visit over Labor day weekend (as I got the Monday off work anyway). We packed up the car and headed south, none of us really knowing what to expect.
			<p />
			What we found was a great surprise. The beach was beautiful - I think that's the only way to describe it. We were very lucky as the weather was fantastic, although it was very windy, but the sun was shining the whole time there.
			<p />
			The town at Cannon Beach is what I guess you would describe as quaint! Lots of little shops and restaurants where you can wander with the dog and then visit the beach. The hotel we stayed in was really nice (well, it was fine considering we had Roxie with us anyway).
			<p />
			We were within walking distance to the beach and went there every day. The hotel also had a swimming pool that we went to a couple of times and some amazing views of the beach.
			<p />
			We had a wonderful time down on the beach, we brought a stunt kite and flew that, and also rented some funky sand bikes and rode up and down the beach.
			<p />
			We were so impressed I even added the location as a place to visit on my home page. This was Roxie's first ever holiday and she had a great time too (I could tell). So after a quick 3 days we headed home, feeling refreshed and eager to return.
			<p />
			We will definitely go back, that's for sure.
