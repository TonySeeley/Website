			<h2>Harlem Globetrotters</h2>
			Sunday 22nd February 2009
			<p />
			I remember when I was very young watching the Harlem Globetrotters on TV with amazement. Of course back in those days it was George "Meadowlark" Lemon and Fred "Curly" Neal! But they were great fun to watch, real basketball skill mixed with jokes and misbehaving antics.
			<p />
			I don't think I ever realized at the time that each time I saw them play it was against the same team (Washington General's) or that the Generals always lost. I guess as a kid it was just incomprehensible that the Globetrotters would actually lose a game - I mean they are the "Harlem Globetrotters!"
			<p />
			So this year, imagine my excitement when the Globetrotters announced they were coming to Washington on tour. I spent some considerable time finding clippings of my favorite moments on YouTube to encourage the kids to get excited and convince them that this was just not a basketball game.
			<p />
			Lisa got tickets and we set off to Everett (which is about an hours drive from us) to see them play. The place was packed and I was finally faced with the opportunity to see these guys play live and realization set in that it may not be that good. You know what it's like, you have these romantic fond memories of childhood and things rarely happened as you remember.
			<p />
			With all my hype however, the kids were quite exited too, and all through the planning Lisa kept saying the same as me, so maybe this was going to be good.
			<p />
			I really shouldn't have worried, they were fantastic. Of course it was all new people, but the fun and skill factor was still there in spades. The Globetrotters tormented the poor Generals and of course won the game. All the same jokes were there that I remember as a kid, the ball on elastic, hiding the ball up a shirt and then getting another basket, outright cheating to win the game - FANTASTIC!
			<p />
			Happily I wasn't the only one with a smile on my face as Lisa and the kids loved it too.
			<p />
			All I can say is if you want to see a great "show" (as that's what the Globetrotters put on), and see some amazing basketball skills, try to go and see this great team - I promise you won't be disappointed.
