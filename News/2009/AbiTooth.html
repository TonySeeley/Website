			<h2>Abi Loses Her Tooth</h2>
			Tuesday 20th October 2009
			<p />
			For the last couple of years Abi has been desperate to lose a tooth.  It's like every kid in her class has lost one and she was really feeling left out.
			<p />
			Anyway a few weeks ago she announced she had a wobbly tooth.  This was a really big deal and she was super excited about the tooth falling out.  Trying to help her we told her to eat apples and chew toffee etc., all to no avail.  That tooth did not want to come out.
			<p />
			Then we visited the UK on vacation and much to Abi's disappointment her cousins Jana and Maddy also had lost teeth.  On top of that when we visited their house Jana had a new wobbly tooth and spent most of the afternoon showing me (I hate teeth that move - I mean they aren't supposed to are they?)
			<p />
			Then a day later we heard that Jana's tooth came out.  Poor Abi. To her credit she didn't really mind and wasn't upset with Jana, she just wanted to join the club.
			<p />
			To make matters worse Abi has been reading a load of bed time stories about young children who also loose their teeth.
			<p />
			Anyway, this week her tooth was really moving about, Abi was helping matters by spending hours during the day wobbling it back and forth and on Tuesday Lisa phoned me at work to tell me her tooth had finally come out.
			<p />
			Abi was SO pleased, she was proud as punch when I saw her that night, and is now spending most of her time experimenting with things that fit in the gap.
			<p />
			Oh, she was also pleased that the tooth fairy left her $5.  ($5 I can't believe that!! I used to get 25p - around 50c - things have definitely changed).
			<p />
			Now she has "joined the club" she is working hard to improve her standing as a member and I caught her in the bathroom yesterday pulling on another tooth.
			<p />
			It's funny as I don't remember this being a big deal for me (or for James), but as I don't remember what happened yesterday I doubt that means much.
