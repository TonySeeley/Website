			<h2>UK Vacation</h2>
			Monday 27th July - Monday 17th August 2009
			<p />
			When do you start to plan your vacation? For Lisa, it's the day she gets home from her last. We visited Mexico last year and on the flight home she started. Subtle hints at first, the "I really miss my sisters" is always a good non-specific. I usually know what's coming after that. Then there is the "it would be good for the kids to see all their cousins again" - that ones a dead give away! Finally, of course, she hits me with the "I think we need to go back to England again".
			<p />
			Don't get me wrong, I love to visit the UK but for me it's not a holiday in the traditional sense. For me a real vacation is either on a beach or by a pool (preferably both). Somewhere where I can swim and play with the kids, away from cars, shops, work, TV, hell, every day existence really. That's my kind of vacation.
			<p />
			Visiting the UK is different. As we don't go there very often we have to make the most of it. The most of it means seeing as many people as humanly possible in as short as time as we can. This means lots of driving. This also means lots of eating out and loads of tea. While the kids do love to see family, I always feel guilty taking them to the UK as it can be a little boring for them. But then if I don't go, I feel guilty not visiting family (as they can and do play the "we really miss you card" very well, I do of course miss them all too.) I guess vacations for me involve guilt somewhere along the way no matter what!
			<p />
			So, last summer, Lisa decided it was time to go back. It had been 5 years and she wanted to visit again. This time she also wanted to go to Devon to see her dad's family in Torquay. This meant a lot of traveling. As a result we decided that I would go with Lisa, James and Abi for 2 weeks, and then come home to work, while they stayed for another week in Wokingham with Lisa's sister, Nikki.
			<p />
			Lisa sent off emails telling people we were going to visit and started the planning process. This planning takes ages and Lisa loves it. She organizes where we have to be, who we will meet, what we will be doing, how we get there, where we are sleeping, basically everything. She works it all out - I do nothing.
			<p />
			So the time finally comes and it's vacation time. One of our neighbor friends, James Gray, kindly takes us to the airport and off we go.
			<p />
			This was going to be a busy vacation. Lisa's plan had us staying in Wokingham with Lisa's sister Nikki for one day, going to London to see my sister Kate and her family, then up to Warwick to see my other sister Jane and Lisa's sister Tracey, then down to Kent to see my dad. Hang on there's more... then it's off to Devon to see Lisa's cousin's and aunts and uncles, then on the way back popping into see on old friend of mine Keith in Exeter, then back to Wokingham to stay with Nikki again. Then it was off to London to see her aunt and cousins from her mum's family and then taking James driving at the Mercedes museum. After that I get to go home. When I'm gone Lisa then takes the kids to the London museums and finally down to Portsmouth to see the ships.
			<p />
			Interspersed with this we get to see Lisa's mum Janet and her dad Roger and my brother Alex, all in the Wokingham area. 
			<p />
			Not only does she organize the places, people and times, but she also tells us when we are eating Indian and Chinese takeaway, fish and chips and Cornish pasties. And as we are going to Devon she even organizes a cream tea for the family.
			<p />
			This was a really busy fun packed vacation, the only sad thing is I didn't take enough pictures and we didn't get as long as we would have liked with family and friends.
			<p />
			We had a lovely dinner out with Roger, Roz and Nikki, Craig, Jordan and Regan this was one of Lisa's planned Chinese meals.
			<p />
			It was great spending the day with Kate, Neil, Charlie, Daisy and Stanley. Daisy and Abi really hit it off and Charlie loves James, so it's great to get all the kids together. We had a lovely dinner and headed off to the park to run around.
			<p />
			Then we went and stayed with Jane, Gerry and Aimee. We went out to Warwick castle and had a blast. While still in the area we met up with Tracey, Ria, Jana and Maddie at Cadbury World, where Lisa stocked up on lots of chocolate.
			<p />
			After that is was down to Tunbridge Wells to see my Dad and Chris. We had a lovely lunch out with them and saw their new flat.
			<p />
			Then we did the drive to Devon. This was really painful as the traffic was horrid and it took us 5 hours to do the journey. When we got there it was fish and chips at Barry's house. We got to see all the family at a barbecue there and even had a really sunny day at the beach. While there we also visited Kents Cavern and the Model Village in Babbacombe.
			<p />
			In Exeter we saw Keith, Julia, Heather and Katie and went out with them for the day. This for me was wonderful. I haven't really seen Keith and Julia for 20 years and we had some time to catch up on what we have been up to, etc. (also great to see the girls for the first time too).
			<p />
			Then back to Nikki's for a few days and then a day in London with Olive, Eddie, Mark and Teresa (Lisa's aunt, uncle and cousins) - I think it has been 20 years since we have seen them too!
			Then back to Nikki's again :-) We then saw my brother Alex and went out for a nice lunch with him, which was really nice. I really wish I had more time with Alex - I miss seeing him a lot.
			<p />
			Probably one of the most interesting excursions was to take James to Brooklands race track, to the home of the Mercedes World museum and let him drive a car for the first time. He loved this and did really well, having to do 3 point turns, emergency stops, reversing round a corner and lots of other driving maneuvers. What fun! I would have loved to have been able to do all that at 12.
			<p />
			Then it was time for me to come home. I flew back and went back to work for a week while Lisa stayed with Nikki and did some more touristy things.
			<p />
			We had an amazing time, it really was a lovely vacation. I should really say big thank you's to Nikki and Craig, Jane and Gerry, and Barry for putting us up and thanks to everyone for making the 2/3 weeks so special.
			<p />
			Next time I may even stay for 3 weeks :-)
