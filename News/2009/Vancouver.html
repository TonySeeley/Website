			<h2>Vancouver Thanksgiving</h2>
			Wednesday 26th November - Saturday 28th November 2009
			<p />
			Thanksgiving was coming and my work amazingly gave me the week off (without me having to take any leave) so we decided to use the time and take a break.
			<p />
			We were also thinking of having the carpet replaced in the family room with hardwood flooring. When you have this done, you have to leave the house for a few days because they varnish the floor and it smells really bad! We actually have a large amount of hardwood flooring downstairs already and all that floor had to be sanded down and re-varnished so it matched the new floor.
			<p />
			As a result we decided to get the floor done while we went away for Thanksgiving.
			<p />
			It's been a while since we have visited Vancouver (6 years in fact), so we decided to drive up to Canada and spend our time there. Lisa found a great hotel called the "Rosedale on Robson" which offered guest suites with a small kitchen, two bedrooms and a living area. So Lisa booked 3 nights there as it was really well situated on Robson Street, that is the shopping center of the city (a little like Oxford Street in London or 5th Avenue in New York).
			<p />
			Even though I had the whole week off, James and Abi were in school till Wednesday lunchtime. So we decided to leave at midday on Wednesday and come back on Saturday (Lisa's birthday).
			<p />
			To make matters a little difficult, the flooring company wanted to start work on Monday so the "fun" started Sunday with us all clearing everything off the hardwood floor and carpet downstairs. This took a few hours and I'm sure you can imagine our "delight" when we found out Monday morning that they couldn't start work till Tuesday.
			<p />
			Tuesday arrived and the carpet was pulled up. There were 4 workmen in the house and they started laying the new floor. The noise and dust was everywhere. James came home from school with a horrid headache and had to leave the house it was so noisy.
			<p />
			Wednesday finally came and we were really pleased to get out of the house. We left the workmen with a key to the house (which we found out on our return was the wrong key and they had to enter and leave the house each day via a window) and headed for Canada.
			<p />
			It took us just under two hours to get to the border and about 10 minutes to get into Canada (which was fantastic). The rain started as we entered Canada and we found out later that it had been raining for 3 weeks.
			<p />
			Forty minutes later we arrived in Vancouver and found the hotel. The suite was fantastic, 2 nice bedrooms and a living area with cooker, fridge, microwave and everything else you could want.
			<p />
			En route to the hotel, James had decided that he didn't want to go to Canada and started a 3 day sulk. We decided to go and get some dinner but James "wasn't hungry" so he sat and watched us eat dinner.
			<p />
			After that we found a 7-11 and bought provisions for the next few days. Bread, candy, milk, candy, cookies, candy - all the important stuff.
			<p />
			Then we retired to our suite for the night and planned our next day. James continued to sulk while playing on his computer online.
			<p />
			Thursday morning we got up early and looked outside. It was the first dry day in 3 weeks so we decided to hit outdoor attractions, as we didn't know how long it would stay nice.
			<p />
			We headed off for breakfast at a restaurant called the "White Spot" and then drove north to visit the <a href="http://www.capbridge.com/" _target="blank">Capilano Suspension Bridge</a>. The bridge is a simple suspension bridge crossing the Capilano River and is 450 ft long and 230 ft above the river. It's found in the Capilano park which has loads of information about native American Indians (lots of totem poles and stuff to look at). The bridge is really cool albeit a little bit wobbly. James liked this however and enjoyed my discomfort as I suffer badly from motion sickness. Once we crossed the bridge we checked out the "treetops adventure" which is basically a collection of suspended bridges high up between trees in the park. The kids had a great time, even James forgot to be miserable for a while.
			<p />
			After the Bridge we drove further north to <a href="http://www.grousemountain.com/Winter/" _target="blank">Grouse Mountain</a>. This is a mountain in the Pacific Ranges and is accessible via a cable car. In Summer at the top of the mountain there are lumberjack and birds of prey shows. They also have a couple of captured grizzly bears that were rescued as cubs. In Winter however the mountain becomes a skiing destination and we found ourselves on the cable car with loads of skiers and snowboarders. After 3 failed attempts of getting our cable car to go up the mountain (yeah I know, doesn't fill you with confidence does it), we were transferred to another cable car and were told they had just finished repairing it and we were the first lucky riders!
			<p />
			Well, we made it to the top and went outside! Visibility was initially terrible as the top of the mountain was in cloud, but every now and then it would clear and you got an amazing view of a beautiful blue sky. At no time could you look down the mountain though, as the cloud cover surrounded the mountain.
			<p />
			We tried walking about for a bit, but I kept sinking and Abi kept getting stuck in snow. Lisa tried to rescue her once and nearly lost her shoe. As a result Lisa lost it and nearly wet herself laughing so we decided to head back into the main complex.
			<p />
			We went to see a film on the rescued bears and then I got a drink while Lisa took Abi ice-skating. James didn't want to go as he remembered he was supposed to be miserable all day and wanted to make up for his earlier happiness. When James and I went outside to watch, he again forgot to sulk and we both fell about laughing watching Abi try and skate. The number of times she fell over was unbelievable and some of the falls were really hard bless her. I will give her her due though; she had a great time and loved every minute.
			<p />
			As we were all getting cold we decided to head down the mountain and visit Stanley Park. We wanted to do a horse carriage ride round the park and thought it would be best just before it got dark.
			<p />
			We arrived at Stanley Park only to find out the carriage rides ended in October. As a result we decided take a walk down Robson Street and do some shopping. Whatever happiness James had before was lost forever over this decision.
			<p />
			We spent some time in Robson Street and then headed to the Spaghetti Factory for dinner.
			<p />
			The following day started off really well so we decided to visit the Vancouver <a href="http://www.vancouverlookout.com/" _target="blank">Lookout</a>. This is a tall building at the Harbour Center that overlooks the whole city. It looks a little like a fat Space Needle although it's not quite as tall. We went up the building and took loads of great pictures. Abi wasn't tall enough to see over the ledge so one of the guides there leant her a stool that she insisted on carrying around herself. We would walk 15 feet around the observation deck and she would plant her stool and climb up to look around. Then we kept going round. She loved it. James, not so much, although I did get him to smile for a couple of pictures (threatened to kill his internet access back at the hotel).
			<p />
			Next it was time to visit the Aquarium. This is in the middle of Stanley Park so we headed back to go and see some fish. This isn't a very big aquarium, but does have a dolphin and beluga whale exhibit outside. Everything else was indoors. The funny thing was the aquarium had a special exhibit of frogs. For those that know Lisa, this was not something she was going to enjoy, but she did go in, and I even got her to kiss a frog picture for a great camera photograph. As it's a pretty small aquarium, I tended to feel quite sorry for some of the larger fish (and mammals). Their enclosures are not that big and they all looked a little mad to me.
			<p />
			After the aquarium it was time to go back to the hotel as I had promised the previous day to take Abi swimming. James stayed in the room on his own and Abi and I hit the pool. Lisa came down to watch and read her book. The pool was bloody freezing and Abi made me stay in for an hour. We had a great time though and Abi got her swim.
			<p />
			That evening we went to another White Spot restaurant and waited for an hour for our food! Poor Lisa had to send hers back when it arrived as it was cold.
			<p />
			Saturday morning saw the arrival of Lisa's birthday and time for us to head home. We packed up the room and loaded the car and headed to <a href=" http://www.granvilleisland.com/" _target="blank">Granville Island</a>. This has a nice public market and some lovely restaurants. Unfortunately the rain had finally returned and we were pretty much washed out. The kids were moaning and James had really found his sulking form, complaining about everything. I was really angry with him as it was Lisa's birthday and I wanted her to have fun, but due to his complaining and the really crappy weather we decided to head home.
			<p />
			Coming home for some reason seemed to take longer - probably because of the rain, and we also stopped for dinner when we were about 30 minutes from Redmond.
			<p />
			We finally got in about 5:30 and the floor was all finished and looked fantastic.
			<p />
			In all it was a great trip (even with James being a misery guts) but Lisa and I had fun (so did Abi).
