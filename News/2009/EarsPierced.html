			<h2>Abi Gets Her Ears Pierced</h2>
			Tuesday 7th April 2009
			<p />
			From the age of about 3 Abi has wanted her ears pierced. She watched Lisa put in earrings and even at that age had friends with small studs in their ears, so the desire was there. But what is a parent suposed to do? I mean, when I was growing up my parents wouldn't let my sister's have their ears pierced until they were 10 or something and for Lisa it was 11. I have to say I have no idea where the "age restriction" came from or why it was in effect, but it was there. And these things stick in your memory and affect your decision making. Thinking about it I still don't know why it's a big deal, I mean it's not like it's a tattoo or anything. Maybe parents are more careful as earrings can get caught and hurt the child - I don't know! Mind you my mum always thought it was a little trashy for very young children to have studs - but times change, etc.
			<p />
			So Abi wanted her ears pierced, the problem was she was too chicken to get them done. At first she was all gung-ho, until we pointed out that having your ears pierced involved sticking a sharp object through your ear!
			<p />
			So we would walk past Claires (a girly accessory shop) and tease her about it. Poor Abi was totally torn. On the one hand she wanted nice shiny objects in her ears but on the other, who voluntarily asks to have a hole made in their body? You get the idea. Of course I was totally understanding over her dilema, and didn't tease her at all - well maybe a little.
			<p />
			When Abi was 5, she was ready. She definitely wanted her ears pierced. She even got Lisa to drive her to Claires where they got her in the seat and had the dot's on her ears. Then, guns in hand, were told, "I've changed my mind". I wasn't there at this time, which is just as well, because I probably would have just held her down! (What a great dad I am).
			<p />
			So this was a common reoccurring thing. We would discuss it and Abi would say "next birthday" and that was it. Or so we thought anyway.
			<p />
			One morning in April (a month before her birthday) she woke up (on a school day) and told Lisa she wanted to get her ears pierced today. It appears that there was no peer pressure from school, she just decided today was the day. Obviously Lisa treated this statement with some skepticism and replied with a "OK Abi, lets see how you feel after school".
			<p />
			Anyway school ended and Abi was still up for it, so Lisa once again set off for Claires.
			<p />
			Abi sat in the chair and allowed them to apply some disinfectant, put the dots on her ears and then shoot her with the guns they use. Apparently it's common practice for young girls to have both ears done at the same time, so a gun is held to each ear and on the count of 3 you get two new holes. This presumably is to prevent the child running out of the shop with only one earring.
			<p />
			I wasn't there, but Lisa told me that Abi didn't flinch. She got her new earrings and is now happy. I say she is now happy, but we still have the occasional tantrum over turning the earrings or cleaning her ears properly!
			<p />
			Bottom line though, no more wasted trips to Claires.
