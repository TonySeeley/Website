			<h2>Skagit Valley Tulip Festival</h2>
			Sunday 11th April 2010
			<p />
			Skagit Valley is north of where we live about half way between us and Vancouver BC.  It's predominantly a farming community and probably wouldn't draw much attention if it wasn't for the crop it's known for.
			<p />
			What they grow in Skagit Valley is tulips!  Millions of tulips actually.  There are fields and fields of tulips of every color and on a nice day it's truly amazing to see.
			<p />
			Every year in spring the farms in the area have a tulip festival and open their doors to the general public (for a nice fee of course) and allow you to walk amongst the tulips and take pictures.
			<p />
			We went there a couple of years ago but it was a bit of a rainy day!  This time we were luckier.  We had a lovely warm sunny day with blue skies and white fluffy clouds and the tulips looked amazing.
			<p />
			Lisa, James, Abi and I headed out for the day to check it out.  James was his normal charming self, totally happy to be away from his Xbox, computer and girlfriend.  Actually that's a lie he complained the whole time.  But Lisa, Abi and I had a great time :-)
			<p />
			There were loads of people there and we spend most of our time trying to take pictures without getting people in the shot.  I got some lovely pictures on Abi who always likes getting in front of the camera.  Lisa not so much, apparently it was a bad hair day and she wouldn't take her hat off.  And James... Well he would only let me take his picture once, and he didn't even smile!
			<p />
			It's funny really, it took us about 90 minutes to get there, we were in the tulip fields for less than an hour and then we drove home.
			<p />
			But looking at the pictures I think it was worth it.  James doesn't agree.
			<p />
