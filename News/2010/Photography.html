			<h2>My New Hobby</h2>
			February 2010
			<p />
			Back in December Lisa asked me what I wanted for Christmas.  I told her I didn't know, had no idea.  But she asked me to give it some thought.
			<p />
			10 minutes later I said I would really like a new Digital SLR camera.  Why a new camera?  I have no idea.  I tried a Digital SLR about 5 years ago when they first became commercially viable for hobbyist and semi-pro's but the camera was slow and in truth I could get pictures that looked just as good with a nice compact for half the price.
			<p />
			Anyway for whatever reason I thought I'd try again.  I like taking photographs and liked the idea of getting a nice camera (things have come along way since my last DSLR).
			<p />
			At first Lisa said that's OK, if that's what you want.  Then of course I explained how much this was going to cost.  Then she wasn't so keen (I think that's the safest way of saying it).  But then she didn't say no.  She did ask me if this was going to be a 5 minute wonder like most of my hobby's and I said probably :-)
			<p />
			So I started my research.  At the end of the day there are two predominant manufacturers, Canon and Nikon.  You basically have to select the make you want and once you select the camera body, you are tied in as the accessories and lenses you buy only work with that body.  I have only had Canon's in the past, but wanted to try something different (don't know why).  I asked friends who had each make and learnt that at the end of the day, both makes are pretty much the same, it ends up becoming a religious debate over which way to go and which is best.
			<p />
			So Nikon it was, next decision was which model?  I spend weeks on this and finally selected the D90.  This was considered to be probably the best of the amateur bodies.  Once you moved up you started spending much more money and even I wasn't sure if I was going to keep this up.
			<p />
			After the camera body you have to select the lens, now the costs start to mount!  In the end I selected a nice lens for my camera and coughed up around $1,800.
			<p />
			Come Christmas I started taking my shots.  I took hundreds, hell thousands in a really short time.  I became the family bore, if you moved in the house I was there snapping away.  In a short time I started looking for more lenses that could give me more interesting pictures.  Once you start getting into this you can spend an awfully large amount of money.
			<p />
			Eventually you hit the point where you need to decide if you want to buy lighting so you can take better pictures in doors.  To be clear, photography is all about light.  Without good light you have nothing, the best light is the light you can control and that's expensive.  Once you go down the lighting route there are loads of choices to make with price changes that get very scary.
			<p />
			So where did I end up?  What's the kit I have now?

			Add to this camera bags, filters for lenses and books, books and more books.
			<p />
			If you have read all this and are observant, you will notice that the D90 is not in the list.  I kept that camera 8 weeks and sold it to upgrade to the more expensive model.  The D300S is kind of a semi-pro model and helps me capture even better shots.
			<p />
			To date I'm nearly $7,000 in the hole! (don't tell Lisa).
			<p />
			Now whenever we go out I have the camera, I have a studio at home and take pictures against black and white backgrounds.  I shoot the kids, their friends and family friends in the street.
			<p />
			I have included a couple of pictures above of the kids, but the small views don't really do the shots justice so I have added new albums to my online photo gallery here: <a href="http://gallery.me.com/tony.seeley#100393&bgcolor=black&view=grid" target="_blank">http://gallery.me.com/tony.seeley</a>.  Check out the Studio Shots album.  This actually has a number of shots taken over the period of a couple of months.  Obviously I have taken hundreds and these are the better ones, but I'm still learning and enjoying the process as I go along.
			<p />
			One of the big time syncs is learning how to post process the pictures well in Photoshop.  This takes hours and I have now mastered the skills to remove blemishes, whiten teeth and eyes, color hair and smooth skin.  I can even rectify photo problems like closed eyes and fat tummy's :-)
			<p />
			Lately though I spend most of my time removing spots and food and cleaning teeth!  But that's just James and Abi.
			<p />
			It's actually a lot of fun and Lisa is really pleased with the results.  We got some pictures professionally printed out in large sizes and they look amazing on the wall.
			<p />
			Also take a look at the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival album, I took some lovely shots there too.
			<p />
			At the end of the day I have no idea how long this hobby will last and have people in line ready to buy my gear :-), but I'm having fun right now and capturing some lovely shots of the family.
			<p />
			I will keep posting new pictures so check them out and let me know what you think.
