			<h2>Becoming a US Citizen</h2>
			Tuesday 9th February 2010
			<p />
			Back in 2002 we were given the opportunity to move to the US with Microsoft.  I was just about to turn 40 and Lisa was 28 weeks pregnant.  All in all it was a scary and exciting time!
			<p />
			Lisa and I had both visited the US many times on vacation but had no real understanding of what life would be like living in suburbia.  We decided early on that the only way to give the move a chance of success was to really "go for it".  So in January 2003 we sold up everything and moved to Redmond Washington.
			<p />
			What we found really surprised us; Redmond provided a culturally diverse community with a large number of families that had moved from different parts of America.  This created a great place to meet new friends who were also new to the area.  We found the Pacific North West to be a great place to raise a family and Redmond to be safe, clean with good schools.
			<p />
			When we moved to Redmond James was 5 1/2 and attended kindergarten.  Lisa and I felt that the experiment of living in the US was fine while James was so young.  We wanted to give the move at least 3 years to really try to see if we could make it a success.  However we both agreed that once James approached Junior High School age (11 in the UK, 12 in the US) we needed to decide if we were going to stay or return to the UK.
			<p />
			Moving to the US requires a working Visa, something that Microsoft provided, but the goal for anyone coming to the states is to get the elusive Green Card (or permanent residence card).  This can take years and cost as much as $40,000 in legal representation fees.  Microsoft paid for the whole process and found a way for me to bypass the initial "Labor Certification" step (that takes around 2 years on it's own).  In the end we were got our Green Cards in 18 months.  This was a huge surprise (it usually takes 5+ years).  I remember asking my Microsoft attorney why I had got the cards so quickly and they told me not to ask questions and just take the card be thankful and run!
			<p />
			Once you have your Green Card you can apply for citizenship in 5 years time.  After 6 1/2 years of living in the US Lisa and I decided we defiantly wanted to stay.  We discussed it with the kids and they too wanted to remain in the US.  James couldn't really remember what life in the UK was like and Abi had no real appreciation of life in England (even though she had visited a few times on vacation).  Add to that the family were settled in a great community, the kids were in good schools and doing well and Lisa and I were happy with great friends and enjoying life.  So we started the application process for citizenship.
			<p />
			The way this worked was that Lisa and I had to apply and once we got our citizenship James became a citizen automatically.  We both filled in our forms and sent off the application with the necessary passport photographs and a check for $595 each.  We also included a covering note asking to process both our applications at the same time.  About 4 weeks later we received an acknowledgement of receipt letter and an appointment to go and get our fingerprints taken.  This was necessary as part of the process includes a background check by the FBI to make sure you are not naughty people!  Unfortunately the lady who took Lisa's fingerprints screwed up and the prints were not readable.  So I received my appointment for interview and Lisa was asked to go back and do her fingerprints again.
			<p />
			So on February 9th at 11am I turned up at the Home Land Security offices for my interview.  I should point out that before this date every interaction we had had with immigration officers was not much fun.  They were always short and to the point, had no sense of humor and were blunt to the point of rudeness (think entering the US and going though immigration there!)
			<p />
			Well from this point on things couldn't have been more different.  The guy who interviewed me was smiling throughout, making jokes and genuinely trying to remove any nerves I had over the interview.
			<p />
			In the interview he went over my application and asked if anything had changed.  He them tested me!  To become a citizen you have to know something about US history and how the government works.  There are 100 questions in total they can ask you ranging from "Who is your Senator" to "Who wrote the Declaration of Independence".  They tell you the 100 questions before the day and even give you the answers!  Out of the 100 they ask you 10 and you must get 60% right.  As I got the first 6 questions right I was good to go.  The interview lasted 20 minutes and at the end he asked me if I wanted to come back that afternoon for the oath ceremony.  I said yes so left for a couple of hours and got some lunch.
			<p />
			I returned to the offices at 2pm and went through the ceremony.  This consisted of taking the Oath of Citizenship, hearing the National Anthem, Reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, watching a short film on other naturalized Americans and seeing a video of the President congratulating you.  The ceremony took around an hour in total and half way through everyone is called up on stage to receive their citizenship certificate (needed for passports and general proof of citizenship).  When I attended my ceremony there were 132 people becoming citizens from 35 countries.
			<p />
			The ceremony is actually really nice and once complete you are a citizen.  The good thing is now the US recognizes duel nationality so you get to keep your UK passport. So that was me!
			<p />
			When you attend the ceremony you can invite friends and family to watch, but as Lisa and I were doing this separately I went on my own and we agreed the kids and I would attend Lisa's ceremony.
			<p />
			Two weeks later it was Lisa's turn.  She passed the test with flying colors (which was amazing because the night before I was helping her revise and asked her what Abraham Lincoln was famous for - and she said, "Wearing a tall hat!")  She also had the opportunity to attend the ceremony that afternoon so she came home and collected me and the kids and we all went back to watch (and take pictures).
			<p />
			Since then Lisa and I have received our US Passports and James' has been ordered and should be here soon.  To get James' passport we had to send off our Citizenship certificates, as he doesn't have one.  So we will be paying for James to go through the ceremony too so he can get a certificate.  Americans born in the US use their birth certificates to prove the status and James has nothing.  Luckily he doesn't have to have an interview or do a test (as he is American already) but they still take $400 for you for him to attend the ceremony :-).
			<p />
			He obviously doesn't want to do it but we will make him attend in the summer holidays.  He will thank me one day - I think!
