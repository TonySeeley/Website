			<h2>New Cars</h2>
			Saturday 28th October 2006
			<p />
			Its funny, you move to a new country, buy a nice new house some cars, fill the house with nice stuff Lisa is happy. :-)
			<p />
			Life is good, you finally get to the point when you have purchased everything, (yeah I know sounds impossible, but if you try hard and marry Lisa its possible) or so I thought!
			<p />
			Lisa pointed out to me last week that both our cars have now ended their warrantee.
			<p />
			OH NO I thought not again!
			<p />
			But Lisa was really good, she wasn't pushing for a new car, just stating a fact, and was saying we should start planning to replace them.
			<p />
			My car actually had done very little mileage, I mean I work 8 miles away and don't use it very much in summer (as I use the Harley), Lisa's though had pilled on the miles and was bashed up and dinged all over the place.
			<p />
			Also things were starting to break, she had an electric door on her van and it stopped working.
			<p />
			So we discussed what we would get instead.
			<p />
			We talked about it and agreed that when we moved here we got the whole car thing wrong.
			<p />
			I really wanted a new Volvo XC90 and Lisa wanted her VW Jetta, but after 6 months, she swapped it for the Dodge (that she kept for over 3 years).
			<p />
			The end result was we had two big cars.
			<p />
			Lisa's became the work horse but it didn't have all wheel drive so we had to keep mine for winter trips up the mountain.
			<p />
			So now the time to consider a change had arrived it made sense to change them both and get the right cars.
			<p />
			We decided to do the following:
			<p />
			Get Lisa a new Van (she really likes them - funny eh), but this time get a really nice one with all wheel drive and get one fully loaded.
			<p />
			Then for me get something smaller, cheaper and fun.
			<p />
			Good idea eh?
			<p />
			And as Lisa's new car was going to be more expensive it made sense to trade my car (that was worth a lot more than hers).
			<p />
			So that's what we did.
			<p />
			Last weekend we popped out to look, and 3 hours later drove home in a new Toyota Sienna.  She absolutely loves it.  Its fully loaded, leather, electric everything, all wheel drive, DVD Player for the kids, it's got the lot.
			<p />
			So we ended up as a two Van family and I had to drive the Dodge Caravan.
			<p />
			You have NO IDEA how much flak I got over this!  What was I thinking trading my car for Lisa, am I mad, what a fool I look like driving a soccer mums car, etc etc.
			<p />
			So my idea of waiting till the new year didn't last, and one week later (today) I went out and traded her car for my new one.
			<p />
			We discussed what to get, and in truth I really didn't know what I wanted.  We liked the idea of getting a convertible, but didn't want to spend a lot.
			<p />
			In the end we narrowed it down to a Beetle or Mustang convertible.
			<p />
			So I went to test drive a Mustang.  It was really nice, the trouble was I couldn't get one with ABS (I know mad!!!), so for a laugh I tried the Mustang GT V8 4.6 liter engine, 300 bhp 0-60 in 4.9 seconds.
			<p />
			HUGE MISTAKE.
			<p />
			So today I traded Lisa's car and drove home on my new Mustang GT (sorry Nikki).
			<p />
			It is beautiful, sounds amazing, and its great fun driving a rear wheel drive manual transmission car again (my last was in 1981 :-).
			<p />
			Check out the pics anyway.
			<p />
			I am now of course skint, but very very happy.
