			<h2>Mexican Vacation</h2>
			Tuesday July 4th - Friday July 14th 2006
			<p />
			So Summer was coming and we were discussing where to go on our family vacation.
			<p />
			I had already decided not to join my sister and family in St. Lucia for her wedding, as the costs for us to come from the US was exorbitant.
			<p />
			So we had to make our own plans.
			<p />
			The last big summer vacation we had was in Maui, and as much as we loved it we felt we should try somewhere new and different.
			<p />
			We had been considering Mexico for some time, the area we liked the sound of was Puerto Vallerta as it was on the Pacific coast and not a long way from us (so a nice short flight).
			<p />
			However we some how ended up with a brochure on Cancun, I really don't remember why or how, but it looked just beautiful.  Cancun is located on the Atlantic side of Mexico just where the gulf of Mexico meets the Caribbean.
			<p />
			The flight time was a little longer, 7 hours instead of 5, but we thought what the hell and found a hotel that sounded great and made the reservations.
			<p />
			Anyway, the date finally arrived and we headed off to the airport at 4am (yes 4am - nice and early).  Our flight was at 6am and we needed to be there with plenty of time.  We were also flying out on Independence Day, July 4th, which actually worked out cheaper for us.
			<p />
			So after the rigours of air travel with two kids we finally arrive in Cancun.
			<p />
			It was very hot and quite humid, but the people at the airport were really helpful and we were directed to our holiday reps without any issues.
			<p />
			We were then taken to our bus transport and driven to the hotel - about 30 minutes away.
			<p />
			The hotel we were staying in was the Iberostar Lindo hotel near a town called Playa Del Carmen about 30 miles south of Cancun.
			<p />
			I have to say the hotel was just amazing, probably the nicest vacationing hotel I have ever stayed in.
			<p />
			We had purchased an all-inclusive holiday so didn't have to carry any money, the kids kept telling me how it was just a great holiday as everything was free!  They clearly didn't pay anything towards the holiday before we left!
			<p />
			The hotel had a lovely kids play area with its own little pool, a lazy river, a volleyball / water polo pool, a large wave pool and two other pools (one of which had a large swim up bar).  The largest of the pools (the one with the bar) was about 400 feet from end to end and took you through fountains, under bridges and past 2 hot tubs
			<p />.
			The hotel also had a beautiful white sandy beach and a number of nice restaurants.
			<p />
			The restaurants included a Chinese, Italian, Steak House, Mexican (of course) and Japanese.  There was also an all you can eat buffet every night if none of the themed restaurants took your fancy.
			<p />
			We, of course, tried them all.
			<p />
			Each morning we would start by having a buffet breakfast, then it was off to the pool, then a buffet lunch, then back to the pool again, then dinner in one of the restaurants.
			<p />
			After that we would head off to the hotel theatre for the big show of the night.
			<p />
			In reality we never stayed that long as the kids would soon flake!  But we always stayed to see the kids club hour where 30 or so kids would get up on stage and take part in all sorts of dancing games.
			<p />
			It was really well run and the kids loved it.
			<p />
			Our kids never actually went on stage of course, I mean James would just be too embarrassed and Abi is still a little shy for that.
			<p />
			So James would watch and Abi would basically table dance while Lisa and I drank cocktails.  I mean - she is supposed to be shy!!!
			<p />
			We had a few excursions out too.  We went shopping to Playa Del Carmen and to Cancun's Wet 'n' Wild.
			<p />
			I planned a few scuba dives, but had actually got off the plane with a throat infection.  (typical - I was fine when I got on the plane and felt crappy when I got off).
			<p />
			I moved a dive to give my throat a chance to heal, and chose as my first trip a dive in some local caverns.  Cave or cavern diving was something I had never tried and was looking forward to it.
			<p />
			Unfortunately, I had difficulty clearing my ears during the second dive - due to my throat infection had now moved up and was giving me some ear issues.
			<p />
			Consequently I chose to cancel the other dives as it just wasn't worth taking any chances with my ears if I wasn't 100%.
			<p />
			So it was back to the pools for me.
			<p />
			We all had a great time in Mexico, Abi started swimming on her own - for the first time (with her water wing arm bands) - James learnt to dive, and Lisa and I got burnt - all the ingredients of a great Summer holiday.
			<p />
			The food was great, weather was fantastic, people really friendly and Lisa picked an amazing hotel - we will definitely go back.
			<p />
			Attached are numerous pictures of the kids and us enjoying our Mexican vacation.
