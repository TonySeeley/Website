			<h2>Legoland California</h2>
			Friday 3rd March 2006
			<p />
			So we moved to the states three years ago with a master plan!
			<p />
			From the West Coast we would spend weekends away traveling and seeing new places and even new countries.
			<p />
			We have Oregon below us, Canada British Columbia above and Idaho and Montana to the East.  So many places to go and things to see.
			<p />
			Well, year one we went out quite a lot - mainly to shops.
			<p />
			Year two things calmed down a lot.
			<p />
			Year three nothing, we had completely forgotten our master plan.
			<p />
			So Lisa decided I should take a long weekend off work and we should all go to San Diego.   Predominately she wanted us to go to Sea World and LegoLand both of which are in or near San Diego.
			<p />
			So she got me at a moment of weakness and I said yes, so she booked the whole thing up.
			<p />
			This story and the next two are about our long weekend in San Diego.
			<p />
			I left work a little early on Thursday night and got home to Lisa packing.  We had plenty of time to get to the airport but Lisa did not want to miss the flight so we left 3 hours early.
			<p />
			We got to the airport in good time and left the car at the long term car park.  Got the bus to the airport and we were on our way.
			<p />
			The plane was not too busy, but we couldn't all sit together.  I sat with James and Lisa and Abi sat directly behind us.
			<p />
			I was a bit naughty and treated myself to a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones at the airport and had a lovely quiet flight :-)  Poor Lisa however had Abi, several books and a DVD player to contend with.
			<p />
			Luckily the flight was only a couple of hours and we were soon in San Diego signing for our rental car.
			<p />
			Then it was one exit down on the I-5 and we were at our hotel.
			<p />
			The hotel was really great, again Lisa did really well.  The room was a mini suite with a bedroom for Lisa and me, a small kitchen area and a lounge with sofa bed for the kids.  It was getting late so we got them to bed quickly and we hit the sack too as tomorrow was going to be a very long day.
			<p />
			The next day we found a place for breakfast and decided to go to Legoland first.
			<p />
			James really wanted to go there in England last year when we went back for our vacation but it was closed at that time of the year.
			<p />
			So Legoland it was.  It was about an hour away north of the city, and we arrived just after it opened.
			<p />
			James and Abi had a great time, they really love that place.  The went on rides, saw models, went on more rides, bought Lego, more rides, more Lego - you get the idea.
			<p />
			Something that was funny was that when we walked round the MiniLand all the places were based in the US.  In the England LegoLand MiniLand is all around the world!
			<p />
			But apart from that it was very similar to the UK version.
			<p />
			James went on the LegoLand Driving School and clearly drives like Lisa, at least when it comes to parking!
			<p />
			The lesson to learn was - he's never borrowing my car!
			<p />
			The kids had a great time, and we were all having fun until around 4pm when the skies opened.
			<p />
			Abi and Lisa had coats but James and I didn't.  So we huddled under a tree and when we decided it wasn't going to stop, ran to the car.
			<p />
			When had to undress the kids in the car as they were soaked, but nobody seemed to mind and we had a lovely day.
			<p />
			So it was back to the hotel for an early dinner and the kids played with their Lego until bedtime.
			<p />
			I think we all had an early night that night, it was a tiring but fun day.
