			<h2>San Diego Zoo</h2>
			Sunday 5th March 2006
			<p />
			It was Sunday morning and we decided this day to visit San Diego Zoo.
			<p />
			The San Diego Zoo is world famous due to its size and conservation and breeding program.
			<p />
			Sunday was another lovely day and we arrived after a full breakfast at the zoo.
			<p />
			The zoo is very big and even though we had a stroller we didn't fancy pushing Abi everywhere, especially as the zoo seemed to be built on two massive hills.
			<p />
			As a result we decided to get the tour bus around the zoo and plan our day.  This was very cool and the driver was really knowledgeable and we saw loads from the bus.
			<p />
			James and Abi really enjoyed their heads spinning this way and that pointing and shouting "over there" etc.
			<p />
			The driver also gave us advice on which way to walk round the zoo and what was good to see today.
			<p />
			After the bus tour we hit the road and started finding all the animals we saw from the bus.
			<p />
			It's funny how kids get used to a certain level of entertainment though, as having been to LegoLand and Sea World and been entertained by performing animals and rides, walking round a zoo looking at animals in a semi-natural environment was not really cutting it.
			<p />
			I also personally don't like zoos that much.  I guess I just feel sorry for the animals especially when you see the usual pacing Polar Bear and elephant etc.
			<p />
			For example the highlight of the day for James was almost seeing the baby Panda Bear fall out of a tree.  He actually asked the keeper if it had ever fallen out before!
			<p />
			Says a lot about kids today I think.  But in their defense I do remember myself really loving zoos when I was a kid and not being into them at all these days.
			<p />
			We also did the Sky Ride from one corner of the zoo to the other.  I loved that as did James, but Lisa does not do heights and felt very uncomfortable.
			<p />
			At the other end we visited the kids petting zoo, but apart from a couple of goats there was not that much to touch.
			<p />
			By now all the walking and lack of entertainment was having its toll on James and Abi.
			<p />
			Lisa too was getting short tempered so we went to get some lunch, which was an experience in its own right.
			<p />
			Basically if you don't eat burgers, hotdogs, pizza or cotton candy you starve in San Diego zoo.
			<p />
			After much searching I finally found a salad, but had to purchase it and take it to a burger joint for the kids (who definitely were not going to eat any salad).
			<p />
			James who has discovered he has an affinity with Cinnamon Buns bought a monster and proceeded to polish the whole thing off.  This was after he had a just eaten a burger and fries.
			<p />
			James has days when he eats for Britain and America!
			<p />
			After lunch we decided we still hadn't seen the elephants and giraffes and you cant go to a zoo and not see those, so we got out our map.
			<p />
			Unfortunately it was a 200 mile walk (or at least it looked like it) so we jumped on a bus that took us again around the zoo.  We got off by the giraffes and took some pictures.
			<p />
			Then we walked down to the elephants and watched one have the biggest poo I have ever seen.  James LOVED that.
			<p />
			After the monster poo we were all exhausted and decided it was time to leave.
			<p />
			I think it's a little sad, as for a day out it was not as good as the previous two days.  I guess the days of the zoo are definitely numbered.
			<p />
			On a positive note, I got to spend another whole day with the family out on a sunny day and despite the tired kids and periodic tears etc. I definitely had a great day.
