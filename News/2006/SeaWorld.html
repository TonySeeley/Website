			<h2>Sea World</h2>
			Saturday 4th March 2006
			<p />
			OK, so LegoLand was out of the way, the next day we were all off to Sea World.
			<p />
			Now this is my favorite place to go, in fact even in Orlando, I can live without Disney, I love Sea World.
			<p />
			So this time to be extra prepared we all had our coats - and of course it was a beautiful day!  Go figure!
			<p />
			We had planned the day based on the big show times, Dolphins first, then Clyde and Seymore, followed by Shamu and finally Pets Rule.
			<p />
			In between each show the plan was to feed the seals and Dolphins, go to the aquarium, see the manta rays, manatees and penguins etc. and do the odd ride along the way.
			<p />
			James really wanted to do the Atlantis ride which basically starts with a water shute and then takes you on a roller coaster ride, parts of which was in the dark (so it was nice and scary).
			<p />
			I couldn't do it as it gave warnings to those with motion sickness and well, what can I say, I vomit everywhere on those things, so it was down to Lisa to take him.  Twice!
			<p />
			It was quite funny in the shows as Abi had never seen anything like this before in her life.
			<p />
			She was actually scared of the Dolphins.  She held on to me like you wouldn't believe - very funny.
			<p />
			But slowly she got more and more comfortable and in the end was clapping and cheering along with everyone else.
			<p />
			She and James loved the Clyde and Seymore show and sat mouth open watching the show.
			<p />
			The Shamu show was also great, but the problems with all these shows is you cant get that close.  The splash or soak zone as they now call it is the first 16 rows of seats.
			<p />
			Now even though it was warm, none of us really wanted 60 degree water hitting us so we sat in the gods.
			<p />
			The kids had a blast and funnily enjoyed the Pets Rule show most of all.
			<p />
			Abi talked about the performing dogs for three days, she loved that.
			<p />
			The kids had ice cream, tee shirts and fun all day.
			<p />
			Abi fed the Sea Lions - James didn't want to as he does like holding fish!
			<p />
			We missed the Dolphin feeding on the Saturday, but the best was yet to come.
			<p />
			Lisa had booked dinner with Shamu where we go to a buffet dinner and get to meet the Shamu trainers and get a private audience / show with the Orca's.
			<p />
			It was unreal, we were sitting 5 feet from the biggest fish I had ever seen (yes I know its not a fish!)
			<p />
			We got the chanced to ask the trainers loads of questions and James made the most of it.
			<p />
			So we sat there watching the whales, listening to the trainers while we ate.  The perfect end to the perfect day.
			<p />
			On the Sunday we went to San Diego Zoo (more about that on another news page) but on the Monday we had a free 5 hours before our flight, so we all went back to Sea World.
			<p />
			Before going though, we checked out San Diego old town where we found the original town Stage Coach and Stable owner's business, "Seeley Stables" which was fun.
			<p />
			So then it was back to Sea World.
			<p />
			We saw the Dolphins again and this time Abi got the chance to feed them, went on the Polar Bear Station and James once again pulled Lisa onto the Atlantis ride.
			<p />
			The kids spent some time in a huge kids playground and we all had a wonderful time, again in lovely sunshine!
			<p />
			By now our week was over and we hit the road back to the airport.
			<p />
			We got home around 10 at night and promised ourselves we won't wait another three years before having a long weekend away.
			<p />
			San Diego - a great place to visit.
