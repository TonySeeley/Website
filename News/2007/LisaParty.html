			<h2>Lisa's Birthday Party</h2>
			Saturday 1st December 2007
			<p />
			I few months ago Lisa and I started discussing what we should do for her birthday.  After all she would be 40 and we should do something special.
			<p />
			We considered, going to Las Vegas, San Francisco or New York, or having a big party.
			<p />
			In the end Lisa opted for the party, stating she would love to dance the night away with all her friends to some good old 80's music.  (I should point out here, Lisa's definition of "good" music includes, Take That and Jason Donovan!)
			<p />
			But it was her birthday and that's what she wanted, so we discussed how best to plan the party.
			<p />
			Two of Lisa's friends in the neighborhood (Heather and Julie) said Lisa couldn't possibly organize her own party and graciously offered to do it for her.  Lisa wanting to be nice of course said thank you and left them to the plans.
			<p />
			Now my (Tony) part in this was basically to sign cheques and keep secrets.  The first I hate doing and the second I am physically and mentally incapable of (at least when it comes to Lisa).  I have learned over the last 20 years we have been together that Lisa hates surprises and actually needs to be involved and make decisions.
			<p />
			As a result when the girls started telling me their plans, I caved and told Lisa to get involved too.  The end result was enjoyed by many people last night.
			<p />
			I have to say, Julie, Heather and Lisa threw a really great party.  We had plenty of food and drink and hired the community center as a venue.
			<p />
			We had loads of tables out with purple and violet table cloths and balloons all around the room.
			<p />
			Lisa had hired a DJ to play all her favorite tunes :-), and the party was a great success.
			<p />
			The only downer on the night was that it snowed heavily yesterday so some people couldn't make it.  I guess either they were snowed in or their baby sitters cancelled on them.
			<p />
			On a positive side though Lisa's mum Janet came out to spend the week with the family to help celebrate Lisa's big event.
			<p />
			The party was kid less and the booze flowed easily.  We had been partying for a couple of hours when Lisa (obviously after having a few beers) decided she wanted to do a "Snow Angel" outside.  By this time there must have been 4 inches of snow on the ground and I was sitting at a table and missed it.
			<p />
			As I was the official photographer she very kindly (10 minutes later) agreed to do it again :-).
			<p />
			Around this time everyone was, well "merry" is the polite way of saying it and most hit the dance floor.
			<p />
			It was especially nice to see Lisa, Julie and Heather having such a great time, and they definitely let their hair down and danced the night away (which was of course the plan).
			<p />
			Julie and Heather had asked Kelly (one of Lisa's friends) to bake a birthday cake.  And what a cake!  Kelly is a pastry chef and wow could you tell, she did an amazing job it not only looked beautiful but tasted divine.  Thank you Kelly.
			<p />
			So Lisa was called to the front where she had to blow out her candles and we all sang happy birthday.  Julie and Heather had also organized a collection and went to Tiffanys with Mary Lou and purchased a beautiful bracelet and ring.
			<p />
			Lisa was given this after she blew out the cake and was really pleased.  (As I write this she still has them on and loves them enormously).
			<p />
			All good things must come to an end and at 11:30 we had to stop.  The community center needed to be cleaned and locked up by midnight, and thanks to everyone helping we were packed up and on our way home by 12:10.
			<p />
			You would think when the lights go on and we start to pack up you kind of sober up a little, well not the case for Lisa, Julie and Kathryn who decided another Snow Angel was needed and all three of them hit the ground outside. :-)
			<p />
			Packing up the cars was made all the more enjoyable thanks to Matt, Al and Cameron who decided to start a snow ball fight.  By the time I got home I was soaked and freezing but smiling after a wonderful party.
			<p />
			Happy birthday Lisa.
