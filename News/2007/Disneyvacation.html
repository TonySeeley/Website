			<h2>Disney Vacation</h2>
			Saturday July 7th - Saturday July 21st 2007
			<p />
			Where do you start describing a vacation to Orlando Florida?
			<p />
			The truth is, we went to Disney in July and I am writing this in December, and as I am clearly very old (James and Abi keep pointing this out), my memory is going, so I can't remember everything.  However I will give it my best shot.
			<p />
			James had been to Orlando back in 2002, but Abi had only been to Disney Land in California (which pales in comparison to the Florida parks).  Also Abi and James were younger when they went and really couldn't remember much.
			<p />
			As a result Lisa decided we needed to go back.  I actually wanted to go to Hawaii, but being fair Lisa said we should ask the kids.  I agreed and Lisa posed the fair question, which something like; "Would you like to go to Hawaii and sit on a hot beach while daddy goes diving, or would you like to go to Orlando to Disney World and visit all the fun parks and see Mickey Mouse?"  You can see how we ended up in Orlando!
			<p />
			The best part was Lisa did all the organizing and did a fantastic job.
			<p />
			We have an Alaskan Airline credit card and for every full cost fare we purchase we can get a second for $50, add to that we had thousands of air miles.  So flights to Orlando and back (direct) cost us $550 for all four of us and that included first class on the way home.
			<p />
			Then Lisa found us a fantastic house to rent with its own swimming pool that was literally 10 miles door to door to the gates of Disney World.
			<p />
			She also purchased all park tickets on line at discounted prices and a rental car for $500.  In total the whole holiday cost us $4000. AMAZING.
			<p />
			So on Friday 6th July we headed off to the airport to catch the red eye to Orlando.
			<p />
			We arrived Saturday morning and picked up the car and headed off to find the house.  We found the house quickly enough, but got there too early and couldn't get in as the cleaners hadn't been yet.
			<p />
			Lisa found a Super Target to visit so we walked round that, then a Wal-Mart, waiting for the cleaners to come and go.  The problem was we were all exhausted as we actually didn't get much sleep on the flight down.
			<p />
			Eventually we were so tied we actually found a car park near the house and caught some shut eye for 30 minutes.  However we couldn't handle it any longer and Lisa phoned the rental company for the house.  Apparently the cleaners still hadn't been but the company said we could go in and get some sleep.  Then if we went out for dinner later in the day they would send the cleaners round then.
			<p />
			So we went to the house and using the key code got in.
			<p />
			The house was fantastic and I have some pictures of the inside.  It had a nice family room and kitchen with a dining room off in the corner.  It had three bedrooms and two bathrooms and a really nice pool.
			<p />
			James was happy too as it had a big TV and DVD player and a play station.  I was happy as it had broadband internet access :-) (and yes I had brought the PC).
			<p />
			We all went straight to bed and had a few hours sleep and woke up refreshed at 4 in the afternoon, ready to really start our holiday.
			<p />
			One of Lisa's friends (Jill) and her three kids were also on vacation in Disney.  Jill used to live in our neighborhood in Redmond and recently moved to Atlanta.  She had arranged to be in town when we were there so we could all hook up.
			<p />
			They had spent the day in the Magic Kingdom and we agreed to meet them for dinner that night.
			<p />
			First thing Lisa had to do was to hit the shops (big surprise) and stock up the kitchen.  So it was back to Target and Wall-Mart to buy everything she needed.  Then we went to meet Jill and the kids.
			<p />
			Over the next two weeks we hit the parks big time.  Lisa had purchased 10 days of Disney Tickets, 2 days at Sea World and 2 days at Universal.
			<p />
			On top of that we obviously had to go to the Disney Village and buy everything we could carry!
			<p />
			Each day we would start by going for a swim, then have some breakfast and then hit a park or attraction.  Sometimes we ate in the house and others we would go to Perkins or IHOP or Waffle House etc.  We would spend 8 to 10 hours in the park, which was pretty impressive really as Abi is only 4 and really took the grueling schedule well.
			<p />
			Then it was dinner on the way home, stopping off for ice cream at a place called "Twisty Treat" before we got home.  Then it was back in the pool for a midnight swim before going to bed.
			<p />
			We went everywhere, The Magic Kingdom (about four times and once with Jill and her kids), Epcot, Animal Kingdom, MGM Studios, Sea World (twice), Universal Studios, Blizzard Beach (twice as well).
			<p />
			On top of that we went to the Disney Village (again lots of times), and Disney Quest where you could learn to draw Disney Characters, play loads of computer games and design and build your own roller coaster.
			<p />
			It was just a fantastic holiday and the kids had a blast.  But I think there were a few things that for me really stood out.
			<p />
			The first was we went one evening for "Dinner with the Princesses" in Epcot.  Abi was so excited and had her picture taken with all her favorites (Belle being her most favorite).
			<p />
			Then there was the time in Disney Village when we took Abi to get "made up".  The girls could choose what sort of makeover they wanted, Abi wanted to be a "Diva Princess".  I swear I have never seen her happier, she sat so still the whole time and looked fantastic after.  She loved it so much she refused to go swimming that night as she didn't want to ruin her hair!
			<p />
			Then there was the time Abi went on Splash Mountain in the Magic Kingdom.  She just made the height restriction and we were really worried she might be too scared.  However she described it later as the best ride of her life :-).  Considering her life is only 4 years, that's not much I know, but she loved it.
			<p />
			Finally, watching James enjoy all the rides in all the parks was a picture in itself.  I think he went on space mountain twice and I've never seen him happier.
			<p />
			The night before we flew home I stood in line at midnight to purchase the last Harry Potter book and was a total bore for the next 24 hours (sorry Lisa).
			<p />
			The flight home was great too as we were in first class and I recognized a number of senior Microsoft executives on the flight (who had attended a conference that week in Orlando) who were displaced into coach as my kids had the good seats :-)
			<p />
			The perfect end to a perfect holiday.
