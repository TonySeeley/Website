			<h2>Abi's 4th Birthday Party</h2>
			Sunday 27th May 2007
			<p />
			Abi turned 4 on May 7th but as her cousins were going to visit in two weeks she agreed to wait until they arrived for her birthday party.
			<p />
			So Lisa's mum Janet, her sister Tracey and Tracey's three girls Ria, Maddy and Jana arrived on May 25th and two days later it was party time.
			<p />
			Lisa had booked "Pump It Up" for the party.  This was a party venue for kids where they had a number of large rooms available filled with bouncy castles and slides for the kids to run around on and expel some energy.
			<p />
			But before going mental on the blow up toys, the kids all have to suffer a safety video telling them all the rules of the party.
			<p />
			As most (if not all) of the kids have been to Pump It Up before, they have all seen the safety video and consider the whole thing an enormous bore!
			<p />
			Still the people who run the place make the kids sit through the video, where the kids are told, "No running", "Only one on the slide at a time" and other such rules as "follow instructions from the staff" etc.
			<p />
			Of course nobody is listening; they just want to get into the play area.
			<p />
			So after the safety video the kids are taken downstairs and let into the play room.  They have to remove shoes but must have socks on (someone always forgets this) and then the kids just run off in different directions screaming.
			<p />
			Of course every rule is broken and they chase each other over all the equipment.
			<p />
			After about an hour, they have been on the big slide, run round the bouncy race track and jumped in the bouncy house.  They also will have had a race over the bouncy assault course.
			<p />
			Of course being loving caring parents, most of the adults feel honor bound to test out all the equipment first or show the children how to bounce "properly".
			<p />
			By the time we are told it's time up, all the kids are covered in sweat and over excited.  You would think they would be tired but for some strange reason it has the completely opposite effect.
			<p />
			After leaving the play area the kids are taken upstairs to the party room, where they are given a drink, pizza and fruit etc to try and slow them down.
			<p />
			It's the funniest thing watching them eat, it's a bit like a plague of locusts devouring all the food.
			<p />
			Then it's cake time.  The birthday girl gets to sit in the blow up throne, while the cake is lit and carried to her while everyone sings.
			<p />
			Then we cut the cake and hand that out.
			<p />
			After the cake is wolfed down, it's present time.
			<p />
			The kids then get their gifts and give them to the birthday girl who's sat on the throne.
			<p />
			Abi gets to open all the presents and Lisa writes down who gave what for the thank you letters.
			<p />
			At least that's what was supposed to happen; we on the other hand had a big issue with all the girls wanting to be "Princess Birthday Girl" and get to sit in throne, so before presents were opened everyone had to have a turn in the chair.
			<p />
			After presents the party's over and everyone goes home.  The whole thing is just over two hours long.
			<p />
			So, I hear you scream, sounds great where are the pictures?
			<p />
			Well this time I thought I would do something a little different so I videoed the party and created a DVD.
			<p />
			The whole thing lasts 30 minutes or so and is all set to music (much better than screaming kids) and you can watch it here.

			Obviously a fun time was had by all and Abi got lots of lovely presents so was especially happy.
			<p />
			Oh yeah, and I got to buy a new camcorder and make a DVD.
