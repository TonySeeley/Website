			<h2>Ice Skating</h2>
			Friday 23rd November 2007
			<p />
			With Thanksgiving over, we thought we all needed to work off the huge amounts of food we'd all eaten.  Lisa and Heather told us there was an ice rink open in downtown Seattle so we decided to take the kids and get some exercise.
			<p />
			So the Friday after Thanksgiving, we jumped in our cars and headed for the city.
			<p />
			The ice rink was inside, and next to the space needle.  We parked the cars nearby and went to rent our skates.
			<p />
			James had skated before (once I think) but didn't like it and in truth didn't want to come today.  All the little kids used skating frames to help them round the rink, James felt he was too old to use the frame and didn't know how to get around on his own.  As a result he was really frustrated.
			<p />
			The girls however, Abi and her friends Katelyn and Megan were having a great time, they would basically lean on the frames and have Lisa, Heather or me push them round.  We all had to take turns as it was back breaking work.
			<p />
			Of course I made the mistake of going round really fast with them all once and then that was it, high speed only.
			<p />
			As a result I got quite hot (as the pictures show).
			<p />
			Anyway, James was not having fun so I spent time with him and after a while he got almost all the way round without holding on to the sides.  He had the biggest smile on his face and was clearly really pleased.
			<p />
			We stayed in all for a couple of hours and all left smiling and happy after a great afternoon.
			<p />
			Of course Abi wants to be an ice skater now and James fancies his chances at ice hockey!
