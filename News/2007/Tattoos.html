			<h2>New Tattoos for Tony & Lisa</h2>
			Monday 21st May 2007
			<p />
			OK, so I admit it I may be going through a weenie bit of a mid life crisis!
			<p />
			To explain how I ended up with tattoo I have to go back a bit and give you some history (you should know by now I can't tell short stories).
			<p />
			About 10 years ago, Lisa decided she wanted a tattoo.  She asked me what I thought and I said it was up to her but she shouldn't go expecting me to get one.
			<p />
			After all I survived 9 years and 58 days in the armed forces and was never tempted, add to that I didn't think I would be able to find a tattoo I liked that I would be prepared to live with forever.
			<p />
			Anyway I was planning on going away for the weekend with some friends at work for a bachelor party in Amsterdam and the Spa Grand Prix (fantastic weekend and a story for another day) and Lisa said she would look into tattoos while I was away.
			<p />
			So there I was, standing on a hill in the rain on a Sunday afternoon in Belgium, watching the Spa Grand Prix and my phone began to ring.  It was Lisa who was excitedly explaining how she had got her first tattoo and she loved it.  It didn't hurt (much) and she was really pleased.  Oh yeah and was I having a nice time.
			<p />
			So that was how Lisa got her first taste of "ink".
			<p />
			For those that don't know the ink in question was a picture of Mickey Mouse (ala the sorcerer's apprentice) on her right bottom cheek. (Very tastefully done of course :-)
			<p />
			So when I got back home the pressure started.
			<p />
			When was I going to get a tattoo?  Was I scared?  They look good on Robbie!  Go on get a tattoo. Etc. etc.
			<p />
			You can imagine.
			<p />
			Anyway about two years ago after I lost all my weight, I declared in a fit of madness that I was going to get a tattoo.
			<p />
			"Wow" said Lisa, "Excellent, what of?"
			<p />
			To which I replied, "Don't know".
			<p />
			So we spent a week or so looking on line and at other peoples tattoos. Little did I realize that this was just a great excuse for Lisa to examine more men's naked bodies in a lot more detail.  Sure I would catch her periodically checking out some half naked guy but she was just looking for nice tattoo's for me (which I thought was really nice).
			<p />
			So after a while I kind of forgot all about it, but of course the ribbing started again.  "Tony would get a tattoo but he's scared..." etc.
			<p />
			Lisa however decided to get a new tattoo even if I wasn't.  She went to a guy in Bellevue and got a small butterfly on her ankle.  At first she was really pleased with it, but for some reason the colour faded and it lost its "bling".
			<p />
			Anyway a few weeks ago, we had the opportunity of going out for the night for dinner and Lisa suggested we check out a new place she had heard of in Bellevue.
			<p />
			We went over there and the guys were really friendly and Lisa immediately started planning her next tattoo.  She wanted some sort or vine around the butterfly to brighten it up a little.
			<p />
			Not to be undone, I hit the books and started to search for something for me.
			<p />
			It was getting a little late and the shop was about to close, so Lisa made an appointment for the following day to get inked up - again.
			<p />
			We left the shop and decided to hit the internet when we got home.
			<p />
			I kind of wanted something either to do with Scuba or my motorcycle.
			<p />
			Most of the biker tattoos in the shop where either skull and crossbones or flames and everything scuba was sharks or octopus and nothing really grabbed me.
			<p />
			Anyway we came home and we started to search the internet.
			<p />
			One of the first images I found I really liked and I had never seen it before so I copied that and kept looking.  After several hours of looking I still kept coming back to the first image.
			<p />
			Lisa liked it too so I decided to sleep on it.
			<p />
			The following day I went to work and all I could think was how much aggravation I would get from Lisa if I bottled out.
			<p />
			So that afternoon I went back to the shop and stole her appointment.
			<p />
			She turned up half an hour later and had to get someone else to do her tattoo.
			<p />
			So, what was it like getting tattooed?
			<p />
			Well that's simple - it hurts like hell.  I started to sweat 2 seconds in and they had to peel me off the chair 90 minutes later.
			<p />
			The worst part was the outline; mind you the shading hurts too, just not as much.
			<p />
			Then for two weeks you have to keep applying something called Tattoo Goo which stops the tattoo from scabbing over and losing its colour.
			<p />
			So it's been a few weeks now and I'm still pleased with it.
			<p />
			It's quite high up so you can't see it even if I have a tee shirt on.  But I like it and so does Lisa.
			<p />
			I am now of course a real biker :-) and have the tattoo to prove it.
			<p />
			And the good news, Lisa has finally shut up. (Mind you she did point out if I wasn't such a coward I would have a second - and her one on the bone of her ankle hurt much more than mine)
