			<h2>Tracey, Ria, Jana and Maddie Visit</h2>
			May - June 2007
			<p />
			We've lived here for nearly five years and one of Lisa's sisters Tracey has been desperate to visit, but with three young daughters just hasn't had the chance.
			<p />
			Finally this year Tracey made it, and to help her on the plane with the kids, Lisa's mum Janet came too.
			<p />
			As a result James and I were unbelievably outnumbered with five extra women in the house.  There was James and myself and then we had Lisa and Abi, Janet and Tracey and Ria (6), Jana and Maddie (4 year old twins).
			<p />
			They were all here for only ten days and really only came to spend time with the family but we still got the chance to visit all the local attractions.
			<p />
			However, everywhere I went I had four little girls trying to hold my hand :-) which was fine but as I only have two hands we all just had to take turns.
			<p />
			Lisa had delayed Abi's 4th birthday party so Ria, Jana and Maddie could attend.  We had the party at Pump It Up and had a blast.
			<p />
			We also took them to Snoqualmie Falls to see the waterfall and the North Bend outlet mall to do some major shopping.
			<p />
			It appeared Tracey shared Lisa's love of the shops as we also spent plenty of time in Bellevue Square Mall.  Poor James and I were stuck in shopping hell, but I had figured out the hand holding issue.
			<p />
			We managed to get around with me holding out four fingers with one girl on each finger.  Obviously progress was slow, but it seemed the most popular solution.
			<p />
			We took them to the Space Needle and Pike Place Market and the kids had a great time.  As for Tracey, it was like she hadn't seen or spoken to Lisa in ten years; they were inseparable and talked non-stop.
			<p />
			For dinner that night we got crab and the girls chased them round the deck as is usual in our house.
			<p />
			When I met Lisa, Tracey was 16 years old, and really didn't want anything to do with me (she was really shy back then and I was quite loud, so I probably scared her :-) and we got married soon after and moved away.  As a result I never really got to know Tracey that well and haven't spent that much time with her.
			<p />
			Consequently this was probably the most time I had spent with her and enjoyed every minute of her stay.  The girls were adorable and it was enormously sad when they all had to go.
			<p />
			Living in the States is wonderful; we are really happy here but miss our family enormously.  Time spent with Tracey and the girls was really special and we can't wait to see them all again.
