			<h2>Racquetball Is Dangerous</h2>
			Tuesday 18th December 2007
			<p />
			Those that know me know I'm not that sporty.  I try of course but suck in reality at most team sports and don't enjoy contact sports at all (I mean you could get hurt).
			<p />
			As a result my army rugby days are over, and the odd game of football (soccer) are few and far between.  I tried basketball a few years ago, but ended up with a really bad blisters that lead to celulitis and I nearly lost my leg! (yes from a basketball blister).
			<p />
			However, I do like racquet sports and over the years have played badminton, squash and more recently racquetball.
			<p />
			It appears I have an eye for the ball and can play, and since losing a lot of weight my game has improved.
			<p />
			You would think of course that racquetball is pretty safe.  I mean, how much damage can you do on a racquetball court?
			<p />
			Well it appears quite a lot!
			<p />
			Apparently (according to Lisa) I'm quite competitive.  I personally don't see this as I really don't mind if I win or lose, but if I do lose it won't be because I gave up.  I do fight for the win.
			<p />
			Depending on work I do play quite often, I'm a member of the sports club ladder and have friends I play friendly games with too.
			<p />
			One friend is Dan Schuster.  Dan and I have been playing each other for about 3 years.  We are very close in ability (although Dan has been beating me a lot recently), and really enjoy our games.
			<p />
			While it's true I don't mind losing, I really like beating Dan ? (sorry Dan) and this has a consequence.
			<p />
			I try too hard!
			<p />
			How can you try too hard I hear you ask?  Well to start with I regularly hit myself with my racquet when I play Dan.  I know what an idiot.
			<p />
			I tend to over reach and do get a lot of hard shots back, but do tend to hit a leg, foot or side or even face (haha) with my racquet every now and then.
			<p />
			For instance last month we played each other and I hit my leg so hard, I had a semi-circular welt on my leg and a bruise for a month.
			<p />
			I often also like to miss the ball and accidentally punch the wall in a particularly over ambitious swing.  I know what you're thinking - I'm an idiot!
			<p />
			Anyway, last Thursday while playing Dan I exceeded my own record for self destruction on the court.
			<p />
			Dan was playing really well and I was particularly sucky (which was making me mad) and in an attempt to return one of Dan's great returns, I jumped in the air to perform what I considered a winning shot.
			<p />
			Not only did I miss the ball, but I landed on the side of my foot and heard a loud cracking sound.
			<p />
			I crumpled to the floor, said something like "ouch" (ok it may have been a little worse) and rolled about on the floor for 2 minutes in real pain.
			<p />
			Dan asked politely if the game was over, I replied politely, yes and asked him to get some ice.
			<p />
			By the time he got back with ice I had crawled out of the court and was nursing an ankle with a small water melon stuck on the side.
			<p />
			The sports club offered to get me an ambulance as I knew I needed to see a doctor, but I asked them to call Lisa.
			<p />
			Lisa arrived twenty minutes later to find me waiting in a wheel chair ready for the off to the emergency room.
			<p />
			The accident happened at 1:10 in the afternoon, and we finally got home from the hospital at 6:30 in the evening.
			<p />
			After x-rays I was diagnosed with an avulsion fracture.  This is basically when a tendon or ligament rips a piece of your bone off.  Nice eh?
			<p />
			However as I had severe swelling, the ER wasn't happy assuming that was all I had and said I needed to keep my foot elevated and not put any weight on it until I had seen an orthopedic  surgeon.
			<p />
			So I spent Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday on my arse with my foot in the air in a splint.
			<p />
			Tuesday morning I got to see the surgeon and he confirmed I was ok to put weight on it and wouldn't need a hard cast.  Lisa was disappointed as she had already picked out the pink cast colour for me (very nice of her I thought).
			<p />
			I was given a huge support boot to wear (that looks like a ski boot) that I could have to keep on for more than 6 weeks.  (Unfortunately it only comes in black - sorry Lisa)
			<p />
			So here I am, Tuesday evening, sitting in my chair in my big boot, feeling sorry for myself, but thankful I don't have a foot that looks like a huge pink penis.
			<p />
			All I can say is racquetball is dangerous.
