			<h2>Our Real Christmas Tree</h2>
			Sunday 2nd December 2007
			<p />
			So Lisa's birthday has come and gone, which means only one thing.  It's time to decorate the house in preparation for Christmas.
			<p />
			We have had a really nice fake Christmas tree now for 10 years, but last year we decided to get a second tree for the house.  We also thought last year that as we lived in the Pacific Northwest, we should have a real tree.  (The logic being here we live in what is probably one of the largest wooded areas in the United States).
			<p />
			Rather than buy a cut tree, we also decided to cut down our own.  So last year we found a tree farm in the mountains where you could find your perfect tree and chop it down yourself.
			<p />
			Unfortunately though, when we went last year it was mid December and all the really cool trees were taken, so we purchased a pre cut tree anyway.
			<p />
			This year though we were not going to make the same mistake, and on December 2nd we set off to North Bend to cut our tree.
			<p />
			It had been snowing for a couple of days and the roads were not great, but we didn't want to wait a week and miss all the big ones so we pressed on.
			<p />
			An hour later we arrived at the farm (after getting lost on the way) and picked up a saw and went hunting.
			<p />
			The farm we went to was called Christmas Tree Creek Farm and had all sorts of trees including Noble, Grand and Douglas Fir's.
			<p />
			My favorite is the Noble Fir, as to me it just has the traditional Christmas Tree shape.
			<p />
			We found a whole field full of them and ran from tree to tree to find the size and shape we wanted.
			<p />
			This didn't take long as all the trees looked great and we quickly found a 9 foot tree that looked fantastic.  Nicely symmetrical and no gaps or missing branches.
			<p />
			We all did some posing for pictures and I grabbed my saw to cut it down.  (There really is nothing quite as manly as killing your own tree for Christmas).
			<p />
			However, by now it had started to rain.  So I was lying on my side, saw in hand (being manly) cutting into the tree getting soaked.  I didn't care though as this was definitely a manly thing to do so I persisted and got my tree.
			<p />
			The fact that I was completely soaked was irrelevant.
			<p />
			While being manly the kids had a snowball fight and offered lots of advice on where I was going wrong.
			<p />
			Lisa and I then carried the tree to the bailing station where the guys who run the farm wrapped the tree in a big fishnet stocking and relieved me of $70.
			<p />
			We all then got some hot apple cider and headed home.
			<p />
			Once home we got the tree in, got it in the stand and decorated it.  While sitting back to admire our handy work I noted the bloody thing wasn't straight.
			<p />
			Although I'm really pleased with the end result I will definitely remember next year to re-cut the bottom of the tree when I get home so its level  and stands straight up rather than leaning slightly to one side.
			<p />
			Oh well - lesson learnt - But we do have a lovely tree :-)
