			<h2>Crab - Yummy</h2>
			Saturday 5th May 2007
			<p />
			OK, so this is an in-joke (and probably not that funny), so to some this will make little sense.  But here goes anyway.
			<p />
			Some time ago James and Megan Gray introduced us Seeley's to the joys of fresh crab.  They told us where to buy great crab, how to cook it and dress it.
			<p />
			There is a small sea food store down in Pike Place market that has large tanks holding live crab.  James and Megan told us what to look for (which is basically the most feisty crabs in the tank), so that's where we get our crabs.
			<p />
			Next door to the store is a little window, that sells wonderful fresh bread.  So next we go there and buy some sourdough loaves and finally we go round the corner to get some nice big ears of sweet corn.
			<p />
			When you get the crabs, the wrap them up in news paper, so it's a race to get home before the crabs die.  We have to get home quick so the kids can chase the crabs around the deck with sticks!  All part of the experience :-)
			<p />
			Of course there is one small problem to all this, we can only have crab on Saturday or Sunday, as the leftovers smell terrible and the trash is collected on Monday mornings.  We made the mistake once to have crab on a Tuesday and then had to wait a week for the garbage to be collected.
			<p />
			So, we usually have our crab over the weekend with the Grays and the Dougherty's.
			<p />
			Well last year in the middle of summer the Grays went on vacation and during a conversation with the Dougherty's we decided to have some crab without them.  It was a lovely weekend and we were all free and just fancied meeting up for a nice lunch with the kids.
			<p />
			Well, while we were eating the crab dinner it dawned on us the James and Megan would hate missing this.  So in true neighborly fashion, we thought this was very funny and so started the tradition of having crab when the Grays were out of town.
			<p />
			So in May this year, the Grays went on vacation so we met up with the Dougherty's and the Roel's for a lovely crab dinner.
			<p />
			Oh and we took some pictures for the Gray's :-)
