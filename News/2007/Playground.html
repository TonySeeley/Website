			<h2>Community Playground</h2>
			Saturday 30th June 2007
			<p />
			If I had any doubts I lived in a great neighborhood, they were eradicated this summer.  I shared a community experience I will never forget which made me realize just how lucky I am.
			<p />
			We have lived in Redmond now for almost 5 years.  We moved into a new development and were the first people to move in.  In many ways this was a huge gamble as we had no way of knowing what the neighborhood would be like.
			<p />
			But we struck gold.
			<p />
			Lisa went out of her way to visit everyone who moved in and we made some wonderful friends.
			<p />
			However there was one thing about the neighborhood that always frustrated Lisa. Our park playground.
			<p />
			We had a swing set with two swings and a huge sand box (that doubled as a cat litter tray) and over 100 children in the 62 homes that circled the park.
			<p />
			Lisa decided early on she wanted to try and do something about the park as on investigation she found that other neighborhoods in the community had large play structures that could entertain a lot more children.
			<p />
			I guess as our neighborhood was one of the first to be built we missed the nicer play areas.  But Lisa wasn't put off.
			<p />
			She went round and took photographs of other areas of Redmond Ridge and sent emails and letters to the residents association, lobbying for a change.  She even tried the builders early on, trying to convince then the houses in Turnstone (our neighborhood) would be easier to sell with a better play structure.
			<p />
			Unfortunately, the houses were selling without a problem and the residents association had no money (as there weren't that many residents contributing yet).  So all Lisa's requests fell on deaf ears.
			<p />
			Lisa didn't give up however and periodically asked for some new equipment.
			<p />
			Last year the Turnstone neighborhood was heavily affected by a state gas pipeline that was laid underground past some of our homes.  At first everyone was concerned that some of the wooded areas would be damaged or destroyed by the work and our day to day lives would be negatively affected while the work took place.
			<p />
			While our access road to the neighborhood was blocked periodically, and we were kept awake at night some times, there was really little disruptions.
			<p />
			The ironic fact that surprised us all most was when the work was complete, the wooded areas actually looked better than before.  Some swamp areas were removed and replaced with meadow grass land.
			<p />
			Consequently we all thought nothing more about it once the workers left.
			<p />
			However, due to the inconvenience that had affected the neighborhood and the rest of Redmond Ridge, the gas pipeline consortium contributed over eighty thousand dollars to the community.
			<p />
			As Turnstone was probably the most inconvenienced, we were told we were getting most of the money.  That was at least, before the storm!
			<p />
			In December 2006 we were hit with a major wind storm, it was so severe in fact that most of Washington state lost power for days, some lost power for weeks over Christmas.
			<p />
			Unfortunately a lot of community areas were badly damaged by the storm and the residents association decided to use some of the gas pipeline funds to carry out repairs.
			<p />
			This greatly reduced the amount of money available for community improvements.
			<p />
			Lisa decided it was time to lobby again.  She wanted some of that money for our play area.  She asked for help and formed a small committee of Turnstone neighbors including Al Valvano, Simon Muzio, Loraine Osborne, Kathryn Skinner and Matt Dougherty.
			<p />
			The committee started a petition and gained support from the rest of the community, they sort quotes from play structure providers and obtained plans one what they could build.
			<p />
			Finally the big day came and the committee presented their proposal to the residents association.
			<p />
			We wanted forty thousand dollars, we had designed a great play structure that could accommodate 40 kids at a time.  It required enlarging the current play area by a small amount and supported code safety requirements.
			<p />
			The presentation went well and the residents association board promised to get back to us.
			<p />
			To everyone's delight the response was yes.  But not forty thousand :-(
			<p />
			The board stated they would give us thirty thousand and asked if there was anything we could do.
			<p />
			We negotiated with the builders of the play structure and came to the following agreement.  They would sell us the structure for thirty thousand but we had to clear the area, increase the size as necessary, build the structure, and put in all the necessary mulch for safety.  They would provide a supervisor during the construction phase to ensure everything was done correctly, but other than that we were on our own.
			<p />
			So on a sunny Saturday morning, sixteen dads from turnstone answered the call and started work.
			<p />
			Having served in the army and carried out some pretty physical tasks I can honestly say it was the hardest day's physical work of my life.
			<p />
			We started by shoveling out eighteen inches of packed mulch, storing it on tarp on the grass.  Then we cut down the swings and dug out the swing cement footings.
			<p />
			Finally we had to increase the size of the play area, which involved digging out a huge amount of grass and dirt and lifting and moving massive tree trunks that boarded the area.
			<p />
			This was eight hours of back breaking work and left us all exhausted and ready for the following weekend when construction would begin.
			<p />
			During the week the play structure was delivered, and the following Saturday the next eight hours of work began.
			<p />
			Luckily for all, the weather was wonderful and the same stars turned up for a day of work.  Lisa laid on a huge barbeque helped by numerous mums, to feed the workers at lunchtime and we successfully build the structure in six hours.
			<p />
			Unfortunately however we were concerned over a huge rock that was too close to the structure and we didn't think we had dug out enough of dirt to increase the size of the area.
			<p />
			So for two more hours we took turns with shovels and pick axes clearing the area to the safe size and depth.
			<p />
			We also moved some enormous rocks away from the structure, in one case having to use a car to pull the rock out of the way.
			<p />
			At the end of the day we were all again exhausted.
			<p />
			The following Wednesday the cement was coming, and some of us turned out to move the cement in wheelbarrows into the footings of the structure. (This was only four hours work)
			<p />
			The third and final weekend was July 4th, and we all wanted that weekend off to celebrate our new play structure, so Friday night everyone came back to shovel the mulch back into the play area.
			<p />
			It was raining so not great conditions but there must have been forty people with shovels and wheelbarrows, men and women all working together to finish the job.
			<p />
			The end result was just fantastic and was truly christened with a July 4th party in the park.
			<p />
			I am enormously proud of everyone who contributed time, effort and lots of sweat to build what is probably one of the best structures in Redmond Ridge.
			<p />
			But especially proud of Lisa who's continued determination won the day and provided the kids with a wonderful structure that they will enjoy for years to come.
			<p />
			We live in an AMAZING neighborhood.
