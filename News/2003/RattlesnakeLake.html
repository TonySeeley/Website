			<h2>Rattlesnake Lake</h2>
			Saturday 6th September 2003
			<p />
			"Hey Tony, Linda and David are going to look at a lake, do you want to go?"
			<p />
			That was how Lisa asked me! What could be wrong with that I hear you ask?  Well, nothing, only the thing Lisa forgot to mention was that the plan was to hike up a mountain next to the lake!!!!
			<p />
			Now it's not that I don't like exercise, I know I know, I used to HATE exercise, well to be honest I still do, but I appreciate it's good for you so do it begrudgingly.
			<p />
			This wasn't the issue.  The problem was we were completely unprepared.  Lisa had packed a picnic and put everything into a cool bag and we were all wearing trainers etc. not hiking or walking shoes.
			<p />
			So we drove in convoy (I followed Linda), down to North Bend and found Rattlesnake Lake.
			<p />
			Sounds a bit ominous doesn't it.  Fortunately there were no rattlesnakes :-)  Apparently you have to go to the zoo to see rattlesnakes in western Washington.  It was called Rattlesnake Lake as the surveyor who found the site thought he heard rattlesnakes.  What he actually heard was the wind blowing Canis grass (I think that's how it's spelt), which makes a rattling sound.  The surveyor probably came from England.
			<p />
			Technical Bit: To add more details about the place, it was once a valley with a small town.  But a dam and reservoir were built on higher ground a couple of miles away, and the land between the town and Rattlesnake lake was porous.  The result was within two weeks of the dam completion the town was under water.  Hence Rattlesnake Lake.
			<p />
			So back to my story...
			<p />
			When we arrived at the lake my suspicions were roused when David, Linda, Jacob and Amaya all got out of their car wearing backpacks and hiking boots.
			<p />
			I was wearing sandals.
			<p />
			Fortunately I had some trainers in the boot of the car so I put those on.
			<p />
			Just by the Lake was a map showing all the hiking trails.  Linda immediately found the one that went up!
			<p />
			Not wanting to look stupid (which of course we are) we all agreed to give it a go.  I should point out at this point Lisa was carrying Abi.
			<p />
			So we started to walk towards the mountain (probably just a big hill, but I was very tired that day).
			<p />
			I think David realized this was not a good idea and even suggested we just walk round the lake.  Then I heard this idiot person (me) saying, "No lets got for it" (what a pillock)
			<p />
			I found a short cut to the mountain/hill across some mud and we all headed off.
			<p />
			Luckily, however, we couldn't find where the trail started (thanks to my short cut I think) Yippee.
			<p />
			I obviously looked very disappointed but Lisa was just smiling ear to ear.
			<p />
			As a result we tried plan two - walking round the lake.
			<p />
			This was actually really nice.
			<p />
			It was a beautiful day, and the views were magnificent.
			<p />
			The boys (James and Jacob) were having a great time and I must admit I enjoyed myself too.
			<p />
			When we got to the other side of the lake, we found a trail that led to the information center of the lake.
			<p />
			We ate our packed lunches (yes I had carried the cool bag around the lake) and went to investigate the information center.
			<p />
			This is where we learned the history of the valley and David found a really interesting book called "How to S#!t In the Woods".  I wanted to buy a copy but Lisa wouldn't let me.
			<p />
			After looking around the center we headed back to the lake.
			<p />
			I should mention here that the water level was a little low in the lake.  This was due to the dam over the hill dropping it's water level (which drained the lake), apparently something that happens at this time every year, and the end of a hot summer.
			<p />
			The consequence was that out of the lake stuck loads of tree stumps.  Clearly the valley had once contained loads of trees and they had been cut down when the valley flooded.
			<p />
			We found some people swimming in the lake and it just looked too inviting, so David and I stripped off (we left out shorts on) and went for a swim.
			<p />
			Jacob and Amaya came too, and James would have joined us if he could have got over the initial shock of the water temperature.
			<p />
			Once you were in it was great though.
			<p />
			David and I swam out to a tree stump and climbed up on top.  This created a great diving area and we spent twenty minutes diving into eight feet of water. Fantastic.
			<p />
			After twenty minutes or so we decided to dry off and head for home.
			<p />
			To finish the day we saw an Osprey dive into the lake and catch a fish, then fly off with his dinner.  Pretty impressive.
			<p />
			What had all the makings of a Seeley disaster turned out to be a lovely day.
