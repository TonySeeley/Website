			<h2>California</h2>
			Friday 7th - Tuesday 11th November 2003
			<p />
			The kids had a long weekend (they seem to have loads of days off school here), so Linda Dennis had decided to take her family back to Santa Cruz to see her friends and family.
			<p />
			Linda invited Lisa and at first it was just going to be the girls (and kids) away for the weekend - wow this sounded good.
			<p />
			Then Linda and Lisa decided David and I should take some time off work and join them too.
			<p />
			As we didn't want to take too much leave, we agreed to take the Friday off and come back very early Monday morning.  Linda, Lisa and all the kids (Jacob, Amaya, James and Abi) would all come back the next day (Tuesday).
			<p />
			Linda had brought all the tickets for her, Lisa and the kids and David brought his and mine.  We were to pick up the tickets at the airport.
			<p />
			So Friday arrived and the adventure began...
			<p />
			The airport was a disaster, we arrived on time, but the flight was over booked.  James didn't get a ticket, so I had to buy a new one for him.  Linda then found the receipt for James' ticket so I had to get a refund.  David and I didn't get any seats until the last minute and the flight was delayed by a couple of hours.
			<p />
			To top it all, the airline lost our case at San Jose airport.  They told us it might turn up later!  Luckily while we were complaining, someone found it.
			<p />
			It was starting to look like a hell of weekend.
			<p />
			We rented two cars, one regular sedan and a mini van.  We then had to drive from San Jose to Santa Cruz, this was about an hour drive over what is locally called "the hill" which I would definitely call a mountain.
			<p />
			It was decided that Lisa and Linda would take the kids in the mini van while David and I took the sedan (things were looking better).
			<p />
			An hour later we arrived in Santa Cruz and found our hotel.  The Coast Santa Cruz Hotel was fantastic and right on the beach.
			<p />
			We all decided to walk down to the sea front to get some dinner.  It had been a long day and we wanted to get the kids fed and to bed.
			<p />
			We walked down the pier and ate at a seafood restaurant.  After leaving the restaurant we heard sea lions barking under the pier and went for a look.
			<p />
			We walked down some steps and found loads of sea lions barking and swimming in the sea.  It scared the kids a little, as they were very big and made loads of noise.
			<p />
			As everyone was tired we decided to go back to the hotel and get to bed, it was quite late for the kids and we were all exhausted after the days travelling.
			<p />
			The following day (Saturday) we had a great breakfast in a small restaurant in Santa Cruz and then David and Linda gave us the tour.
			<p />
			We saw their old houses and some of the local scenery.  It was fun as Santa Cruz seemed to be stuck in the sixties. Loads of hippy type shops and people everywhere.
			<p />
			We had arranged to meet up with some of David and Linda's friends at lunch time and we all met at a beach playground.
			<p />
			The kids played, we all talked and Abi had her first go on a swing.
			<p />
			We went for a walk down at the beach and saw a guy kite surfing jumping the waves.  Very cool and probably the new sporting fad to come out of California.
			<p />
			That evening Jacob and James had been invited to a birthday party. Aidan, one of Jacobs old friends was 6, so we took the kids round.  Susanna, Aidan's mum had built a bionical Lego island for the kids to play with.  The party theme was bionicals.
			<p />
			Obviously the kids had a great time.
			<p />
			While the kids were at the party, we decided to check out the shops.  Linda and Lisa found some shoe shops (what a surprise) and we grabbed a quick dinner at a restaurant in Santa Cruz.
			<p />
			After picking up the kids we returned to the hotel for bed.
			<p />
			Sunday morning we ate breakfast in the hotel and hit the road.  The plan for the day was to drive to Carmel (about an hour away) to visit David's parents' house.
			<p />
			We had met his parent's, Steve and Sona, in Seattle and were looking forward to seeing their home, they had told us loads about it.  The house was just amazing, probably the most beautiful home I have ever been to.  Steve and Sona were wonderful, gave us a tour of their home and took us all to lunch in Carmel.
			<p />
			After lunch we walked down the beach.  It was a beautiful day, quite warm and very sunny.  Again we saw more kite surfing and surfers.  Abi discovered sand and James, Jacob and Amaya had a great time.
			<p />
			After the beach we had some ice cream and decided to head for home.
			<p />
			Sunday night was the adult's night out.  We had arranged a baby sitter and went to a bar/restaurant to meet up again with David and Linda's friends without the kids in tow.
			<p />
			The restaurant was really funny.  In the middle of nowhere, with a small stage where the waitresses performed between courses.  Apparently the owner also has an act that involved stripping off and doing an Elvis impersonation or something.  Unfortunately, he has Sunday off - so we missed that...
			<p />
			After dinner we drove back to the hotel and tried to get to sleep as quickly as possible.  David and I had to leave at 5am the following morning to catch our flight.
			<p />
			Monday morning we hit the road on time and drove over the "hill" to San Jose airport.
			<p />
			We arrived back in Seattle by 8am and were in work by 9:30.
			<p />
			Quite a weekend.
			<p />
			Linda, Lisa and the kids stayed the extra day.  On Monday they drove to Monterey to go to the Monterey Bay Aquarium (where Steve and Sona work part time).  I asked Lisa to describe it to me but she just said it was amazing - so no more information than that I'm afraid.
			<p />
			They had a great day anyway.
			<p />
			Tuesday afternoon, they all got back exhausted.
			<p />
			The end of an excellent weekend.
