			<h2>Vancouver</h2>
			Saturday 19th July 2003 - Sunday 20th July 2003
			<p />
			I guess after living in England for nearly 40 years, I never thought I would ever be able to say, "Lets go to Vancouver for the weekend".
			<p />
			In reality I still haven't said it, however Lisa did, so we went, and what a weekend!
			<p />
			This came about as David and Linda Dennis decided to go and asked us if we would like to join them.
			<p />
			The plan was, we would leave work early Friday afternoon and drive up to Vancouver, then return Sunday night.
			<p />
			As none of us had been before (David had but he was very young then), Lisa asked Janae (one of her new friends) for advice on where to stay, where to go etc.
			<p />
			So Friday came and we started our 150 mile journey to Vancouver.
			<p />
			We left around 4:30 in the afternoon and hit some terrible traffic just north of Seattle, as a result it took us two and half hours to reach the Canadian border.  We then had a 45 minute wait to cross into Canada.  This was due to the amount of traffic queuing and as usual we picked the worst queue to sit in.
			<p />
			Once we got to the Canadian immigration official it was really quick.  They just asked where we were going and for how long, and that was it we were in Canada.  They didn't even open our passports.
			<p />
			Once in Canada, we drove the 30 miles to Vancouver, which took another hour.  Reaching the edge of the city was quite quick, but it took us 30 minutes to get through the city to our hotel.  We had booked rooms in the Pacific Palasaides hotel in downtown, right on Robson Street (for those who don't know Vancouver that's right in the centre of town, where all the shops and restaurants are located.)
			<p />
			By the time we had checked in it was 10pm, but Robson Street was packed.  The city seemed to come to life at night, there were thousands of people walking about, going to dinner, clubs and pubs etc.
			<p />
			As we hadn't eaten any dinner we walked down the road to a Red Robin, restaurant and got a late dinner.  James of course thought this was fantastic, eating out at night.
			<p />
			David, Linda, Jacob and Amaya had to leave Seattle at 7pm so they weren't going to arrive until midnight.
			<p />
			After dinner we went back to the hotel and all went to bed.  The hotel room was a small suite with one bedroom with a double bed, and a sofa bed in the living room.
			<p />
			James didn't want to sleep on the sofa bed (and I knew I wasn't going to) so we all crashed out on the bed. We had brought Abi's Moses Basket so she was happy.
			<p />
			The following morning we all got up and phoned David's room, they had all arrived late the night before and we all agreed to go out to breakfast together.
			<p />
			We walked down Robson Street and were directed to a CrÃªpe restaurant where we all had pancakes for breakfast.
			<p />
			Through breakfast I showed the kids a coin trick and it blew them away.  I have never been any good at slight of hand, but they totally fell for the trick thinking I made a coin disappear in my arm and reappear out of their nose's when they coughed.  This set the scene for the rest of the weekend where they kept asking me to make coins disappear.
			<p />
			After breakfast we decided to walk to Stanley Park.  Stanley Park is an enormous park in the centre of Vancouver, it's about 4 miles square and contains loads of attractions.
			<p />
			We didn't realize however how far it was, and walking a couple of miles with 4 kids was a nightmare.
			<p />
			When we arrived we decided to go to the aquarium.  We were all pretty tired of walking and found ourselves at a free shuttle stop that ferried people round the park.  As a result we decided to catch the bus.  It took ages to get onboard, take apart the stroller and load it in the front o the bus, only to find the aquarium was the next stop.
			<p />
			The aquarium was fun, although some of the exhibits were quite small.  They even had a dolphin display and we all thought the size of the tanks were a little cruel.  Then we went and saw the Beluga Whale show, again in quite small tanks.  We were told we were sitting in the splash zone, but fortunately none of us got wet.
			<p />
			After walking round the aquarium, we decided to explore the park some more.
			<p />
			One part of the park was dedicated to local artists selling their paintings.  We saw some real talent, and even found one artist (amazingly from England) who we liked a lot.
			<p />
			After the artists area we walked to the Children's Miniature Railway.  We all got on board and were trained round part of the park.
			<p />
			As it was now into the afternoon we decided we needed food and left the park to go to a restaurant in Granville Island called the Bridges.  This took two bus trips but turned out to be a great place to eat.  The Bridges was on the waterfront, the food was excellent.
			<p />
			After dinner we walked through Granville Island looking for taxi's to take us home.  On the way we found an Australian street entertainer who entertained us with his juggling act.  Even Jacob got involved, being the child volunteer, earning himself $5.
			<p />
			After the show we caught cabs back to the hotel.  I was all for going to bed, but James and Lisa wanted to go swimming.  So we headed down to the pool and gave Abi her first swimming lesson.
			<p />
			This was a great end to the day and sufficiently tired out James, such that he went to sleep when we got back to the hotel room almost immediately.
			<p />
			What a Saturday!
			<p />
			Sunday started a little later, and we all went for breakfast together to plan the day.
			<p />
			After breakfast we checked out of the hotel and drove towards Grouse Mountain to visit the Capilano Suspension Bridge and Park.  This was amazing.  Basically 110 years ago, some idiot called George Mackey found this river in a valley and decided to help the natives build a suspension bridge across the river.  To put this in perspective, this bridge is 450 feet long and 230 feet hight!!!  Mad eh?
			<p />
			Anyway this is now a tourist attraction and we decided to visit.
			<p />
			The bridge was fantastic though, it swayed loads in the wind with a fantastic view, however, loads of people wouldn't look over the edge (Lisa included).
			<p />
			The kids enjoyed this place as there was a kind of scavenger hunt for stamps on a piece of paper they had to fill.
			<p />
			Nice place to visit, especially if you like totem poles !!!
			<p />
			After Capilano Bridge we headed for Grouse Mountain to ride the cable car to the top.
			<p />
			Saturday had been really hot, but Sunday was overcast, so as we climbed the mountain in the cable car we broke through the cloud.
			<p />
			Once at the top, it all seemed a little disappointing as we couldn't see anything.  As a result we decided to have some lunch and see if the cloud lifted.
			<p />
			Lucky, by the time lunch was over the cloud cover had risen to produce amazing views.
			<p />
			We walked a bit further up the mountain passed loads of chainsaw sculptures to find a Grizzly Bear Refuge, where two bear cubs played in a pool.  This was great to see and I filmed them play fighting.
			<p />
			After this we went to see the Lumberjack show.  This for me made the weekend.  It was really funny and included most of the common lumberjack skills.  It became apparent quite early on in the show that lumberjacks are mad.  They clearly used to live very dangerous lives, climbing trees to chop them down, starting at the top!!!
			<p />
			Two great things happened in the show, one was one of the lumberjacks created a child's chair out of a log using a chainsaw.  They then offered to give it away to the youngest child in the audience.  So I had that to carry around for the rest of the day.
			<p />
			The other was one of the spectators was very drunk and heckled the show.  The idiot then proceeded to sneak round the back to climb a 100 foot pole.
			<p />
			We really thought at first this guy was 'one of us' watching, but as he got more outrageous it became obvious he was part of the act.  Having said that, it was very, very funny, especially when he fell from the top of the poll and slide down a wire upside down hanging from one foot.
			<p />
			The last show we went and saw was a Birds in Motion show.  This showed loads of birds of prey and showed how they are trained and looked after.
			<p />
			Grouse Mountain was brilliant, we all loved it and enjoyed the cable car ride back down the mountain.
			<p />
			It was now 4pm and we decided to head for home.
			<p />
			The drive home was pretty uneventful, we got through Vancouver in about an hour and the US border in 10 minutes.
			<p />
			We stopped twice on the way home, once to get some dinner and once to cuddle Abi who had decided to cry herself purple.
			<p />
			We arrived home about 9:30 and all agreed it had been a fantastic weekend.
