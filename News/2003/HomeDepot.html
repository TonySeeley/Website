			<h2>James' Home Depot Job</h2>
			Saturday 5th July 2003
			<p />
			The Home Depot (<i>pronounced de-poe</i>) is the US equivalent of the UK's B&Q (although I think The Home Depot came first and actually owns B&Q).
			<p />
			Every couple of weeks the people at Home Depot invite children (yes children - are they mad!!!) to come in and make something.
			<p />
			This was James' second visit, and he invited along Jacob and Amaya.
			<p />
			The first time James went he made a "Gentleman's Box", which was <i>supposed</i> to be given to his lovely daddy for Fathers Day.  James however decided to keep it himself for his special possessions (bits of string and stones).
			<p />
			This time they all had to make a planter box.
			<p />
			Each child is given a Home Depot apron, the same one employees wear.  The are also given a "kit", comprising all the necessary parts and are let loose with glue, sanding blocks, hammers and nails.  (I know - terrifying).
			<p />
			Children must be accompanied by an adult (OK so they are not <i>that</i> stupid) and build their kit on the premises.
			<p />
			An "Expert" (some old guy who made the kit last night), gives advice to the children (and adults/parents) on what to do, pitfalls to look out for etc.
			<p />
			Then the fun begins.
			<p />
			This usually (can say that as I have done this twice now) goes something like this.
			<p />
			<ol>
				<li>Dad (me) opens the kit.</li>
				<li>James hits the floor with the hammer.</li>
				<li>Dad removes hammer and gives James a sanding block.</li>
				<li>James throws sanding block and hammers floor.</li>
				<li>(Repeats for 5 minutes - details removed for brevity).</li>
				<li>Dad sands all pieces of wood (including the ones James has done, as they have just not been sanded properly).</li>
				<li>James looks for nails.</li>
				<li>Dad tries to explain to James how hammers work etc. (don't hit dads fingers, hit nail on the top, don't hit dads fingers, hit nail straight, don't hit dads fingers).</li>
				<li>Dad retrieves nails from hiding place.</li>
				<li>Dad assembles wood and starts the first nail off.</li>
				<li>James hits dads fingers, thumb, hand and wrist.</li>
				<li>Dad cries.</li>
				<li>Continue process until the item is assembled.</li>
			</ol>
			(<i>In this particular assembly dad only had to pull the pieces apart once, due to nails sticking out the side.</i>)
			<p />
			Total assembly time 20 minutes.
			<p />
			I should point out the place they give you to assemble the kit is like a sweatbox and I usually loose a few pounds dripping all over the floor (nice eh?)
			<p />
			Throughout the process, Abi amazingly sleeps soundly, despite the continuing hammering and shouting around us.
			<p />
			Once the planter box is finished each child gets to have it officially stamped (same old guy) and have their names written on it in black marker pen.
			<p />
			By now of course James is bored and wants something to eat.
			<p />
			All in all another great day out.
			<p />
			Question is, where am I going to hide the planter box?
