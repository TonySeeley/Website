			<h2>Snow Tubing</h2>
			Sunday 9th February 2003
			<p />
			I (Tony) have a friend I sometimes work with who lives in San Jose in California.  He has been asked to move to Seattle, so he was up here this week with his family checking it out.
			<p />
			His name is David and is married to Linda and they have two children, a boy (5 years old) called Jacob (James got on well with him but keeps calling his Draco) and a little girl who's 2 years old call Amaya.
			<p />
			Anyway we had dinner with them and decided to go to the ski slopes to take the kids tubing (basically sliding down a mountain in an inner tube).
			<p />
			The place we go to, to do this is called Snoqualmie Summit and is about 50 minutes drive from our house.  They have 4 major ski slopes there and the tubing slopes.
			<p />
			Anyway, we agreed to meet them at 1pm so we set off after lunch.  To get there you just drive down a local freeway (motor way) for 40 minutes.
			<p />
			It was really weird as it was quite an overcast day, not raining or anything, but cloudy.  We were driving along the freeway, slowly climbing higher and higher.  We eventually hit loads of fog.  At least at first we thought it was fog, it was actually clouds.  We were a bit disappointed by then as we knew we were only about 10 miles away and there was no snow.
			<p />
			So finally we break though the clouds and encounter the most amazing view.
			<p />
			You are going to have to imagine this, but the sky was blue and we are surrounded by snow topped mountains.  Absolutely beautiful.
			<p />
			Five minutes later we find the slopes and join David and his family for the afternoon.
			<p />
			We had to wait for about an hour to tube down the slopes (as its very popular at the weekend and they only let so many people do it at a time).
			<p />
			So we brought our tickets ($15 for me, $5 for Lisa to watch, and James was free) and waited for our 2 hour session to begin.  (Actually we went shopping for gloves as I didn't have any).
			<p />
			When it got to our time, we went to the slope and all got a tube (except Lisa as I wouldn't let her have a go).
			<p />
			I went over the side first.  James was going to follow me.
			<p />
			You go down this slope at about 30 miles an hour (I'm really serious), it scared the hell out of me and all I could think of was James was about to follow.
			<p />
			You are bouncing and spinning as you go down too, so its very scary!!!
			<p />
			So I get to the bottom and see Lisa has pushed James over the edge.
			<p />
			He bounces and spins on his way down, probably topping 25 miles an hour and I'm there at the bottom to greet him.  He was white with fear and crying his eyes out.  He was absolutely terrified (and I have to say I'm not surprised).
			<p />
			So next, Jacob comes down and loves it.  We all decide that that slope was too fast and there are some smaller ones a little way along.
			<p />
			James begrudgingly goes again, and again cries his eyes out.  I thought then he had had enough but through sobs he tells me he wants to try one more go!!! (I couldn't believe it)
			<p />
			So he goes again, gets to the bottom and has the biggest grin you have ever seen.
			<p />
			To get back to the top, you go to a pulley hook thing that pulls you up the slope (he liked this too).
			<p />
			Anyway, 2 hours later, and about 15 runs later we are all exhausted, bruised (I fell off about 3 times) with massive smiles on our faces.
			<p />
			We also got to see the sun go down over the mountains which was also spectacular.
			<p />
			I have to say it was one of the best days out with the family I think I have ever had.
			<p />
			James and I are going to take skiing lessons (don't know when, probably after I heal properly) and try and get there twice a month.
			<p />
			What a day :-)
			<p />
