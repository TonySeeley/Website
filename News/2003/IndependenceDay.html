			<h2>Independence Day</h2>
			Friday 4th July 2003
			<p />
			Today we experienced our first 4th July celebrations.
			<p />
			There is a running joke here in Washington that summer does not actually arrive until July 5th.  As a result we were expecting a rainy day.
			<p />
			As we are new to the community we decided to go to the community celebrations.
			<p />
			There was going to be a procession all the kids could join on their bikes, a barbeque and some kids entertainment, clowns, bouncy castles etc.
			<p />
			Our friends who are also moving into the community, David and Linda were also going, so they turned up at our house at 10:30 in the morning to decorate the kids bikes.
			<p />
			We tied streamers and balloons etc. to their bikes and helmets and set off for the parade.
			<p />
			There are a few hills in Redmond Ridge (nothing major) but James complained up every one.  At one point I took his bike off him and threatened to take him home. (It was starting to look like the beginning to a great day!!).
			<p />
			We finally arrived only to find we had missed the parade, so we went to sit on the grass by the barbecue and bouncy castles.  Unfortunately the ground was damp and we had forgotten to bring our picnic blanket.  Luckily Linda had one so we all sat on that.
			<p />
			The kids, James, Jacob and Amaya, all wanted to go on the bouncy castle so David and I took them over.  James immediately got frustrated (as he couldn't bounce properly with all these kids here, and Jacob kneed him in the face) so he spend 20 minutes trying to bounce while sulking.
			<p />
			So, after fun on the castle, we decided to join the rather long queue for food. There were approximately 100 people in front of us and after queuing for 20 minutes and not moving, we decided we had had enough.
			<p />
			The new plan was for the girls and kids to stay and for David and I to go to Fred Meyer and buy some lunch.  So we left them and headed into Redmond.
			<p />
			40 minutes later we returned to find the queue has gone and Lisa, Linda and the kids had eaten.  Fortunately the food was disgusting and they were all over us.
			<p />
			James sulked again as I had forgotten to get him his favourite drink, but did eat some of his sandwich after I told him no fruit rollups unless he ate something first.
			<p />
			The weather through all this was glorious.  Not stupidly hot but high 70s... <i>Or so I thought.</i>
			<p />
			We decide after half an hour to head back home, so we pick up our stuff and headed back to the car and bikes. (I had left my car nearby when I got back from the shops).  So I drove home and the others followed on foot/bikes.
			<p />
			We agreed to meet later that evening to see the fireworks down in Marymoor Park, so David and Linda left with their kids so they could get some rest before we met up at 8pm.
			<p />
			About an hour later, I pointed out to Lisa her legs looked very red, one of them in particular looked very sore.  She then pointed out my head looked like a belisher beacon.  We both checked our own sun burn and came to the conclusion it has been hotter than we thought.  Fortunately James had worn sun block and Abi was kept in the shade, but Lisa and I hadn't really bothered.
			<p />
			2 hours later when David and Linda came back I was glowing beautifully.  Luckily for Lisa, long trousers covered her embarrassment.  I just looked like an idiot.
			<p />
			Not to let it ruin our day, we decided to go to the fireworks display.  We had also agreed to meet up with some of the English relocation team there too.
			<p />
			We arrived at Marymoor Park about 20 minutes later and as we walked to meet everyone else I suffered the humiliation of every one looking and pointing at my head.
			<p />
			Of course my English friends were very sympathetic (NOT) and had enormous fun taking the mickey.
			<p />
			To while away the time we played a bit of football demonstrating to our American friends our prowess on the football field (and my ability to sweat for England).
			<p />
			We had to wait till 10pm for the fireworks to start and it slowly got dark as the time drew nearer.  You would think that as we were so ill prepared for the barbecue earlier in the day, we would have thought to bring a picnic rug and coats etc. for the evening. WRONG.  We had forgotten everything.
			<p />
			Abi was obviously getting cold and Lisa had complained she was cold when she got out of the car when we arrived!  Now the sun had gone down, it was definitely getting cooler.  On a bright note, we weren't worried about loosing the kids in the field as apparently you could see my head for miles.
			<p />
			The field had filled up my 10pm with loads of people, well into the hundreds possibly even thousands.
			<p />
			The fireworks display then began.
			<p />
			It was really very good.  The display went on for about 30 minutes and must have cost a load.  We didn't pay anything to get in so all in all great value.
			<p />
			What was strange was that there was no music, that would have been even better.  We did point this out during the display and considered singing "Land of Hope and Glory" etc., but decided against it (we were heavily out numbered).
			<p />
			I was lying on a picnic rug with James on top of me but found I couldn't get up when the fireworks finished.  I had somehow pulled something in my back and was stuck on all fours.  Again, highly amusing for everyone.
			<p />
			Everyone else just packed up around me and said they would see me on Monday (possibly) at work.  Fortunately after about 5 minutes I loosened up and found my feet again.
			<p />
			We said our goodbyes and walked back to the car (head glowing) and queued to get out.
			<p />
			It actually wasn't that bad, and the traffic marshals and police had us all back on the main roads driving home within 20 minutes.
			<p />
			All in all a day to remember (or one I certainly won't forget)
