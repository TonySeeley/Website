			<h2>We Finally Move In</h2>
			Thursday 13th March 2003
			<p />
			After waiting 2 months, my social security number finally came through and we closed on our new house.
			<p />
			We agreed to move in on Thursday 13th March, although we actually got the keys the day before. We phoned everyone and told them Thursday was they day and planned a massive moving in operation.
			<p />
			Unfortunately the removal company who were delivering all our UK furniture wrote down Thursday 14th so did not turn up until the next day! This did turn out to be a blessing in disguise, as we had so much going on, on the Thursday we would never have coped with the removal men too.
			<p />
			On Thursday, I hired a van to move everything form the apartment and spent most of the day driving round collecting "stuff" we had previously brought to take to the house, while Lisa stayed at home waiting for purchased furniture deliveries.
			<p />
			Thursday night we (Lisa, James and I) slept in the house in James' new bed (which is a double/single bunk bed) while Lisa's mum slept on one of the new sofas downstairs.
			<p />
			We brought James a basketball hoop (a proper US one), it was the most complicated thing I have ever assembled. Those that know me, know how inept I am at DIY, well apparently I'm rubbish at building basketball hoops too - it took me 4 hours!. When I'd finished it was dark out side, but I still made James come out at get a basket.
			<p />
			Anyway, after two days of hell we were in - but with no TV!!!!!
			<p />
			We did have a TV delivered, but I had purchased a satellite dish (called DirecTV, similar to Sky in the UK) and it hadn't arrived. As a result we had a very busy weekend trying to find things to do rather than watch TV.
			<p />
			The following Monday the dish arrived and we all got excited over having TV again (how sad), unfortunate when the guy turned up, I had purchased the wrong satellite LNB (the part at the end of the dish arm) so he had to go away without turning us on. Two days later he came back and set it all up. I found it funny that I was getting loads of grief from Lisa and her mum how I couldn't survive with out TV, and the moment the picture came on, they started cheering and shouting and sat down and watched 20 minutes of a test reception channel.
			<p />
			Two weeks further on, we are pretty much back to normal. The house is fantastic although there are toys all over the floor (in nearly all the rooms). And we still have to buy a dressing table for our bedroom (all our clothes are all over the floor).
