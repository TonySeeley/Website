			<h2>Jingle Bell Run</h2>
			Sunday 14th December 2003
			<p />
			For those that don't know I have been on a diet since August.
			<p />
			I will be posting on the site more information about the diet in the future, but I have definitely been busy.  In 20 weeks I have lost 75 lbs and exercised on average 5 days a week.
			<p />
			When I started exercising all I could do was walk on a tread mill - pretty pathetic really.
			<p />
			After about 10 weeks I started jogging, nothing major and definitely not far.  You have to remember before I started the diet I couldn't run for a bus, let alone run a mile.
			<p />
			I have also spent the last 20 weeks lifting weights, so my fitness has definitely improved.
			<p />
			About 5 weeks ago I started joking with my trainer that I should enter a run.  I was really joking, but my trainer took me seriously.
			<p />
			She suggested I enter the Seattle annual Jingle Bell Run.  This is a 5K (3.1 mile) run for charity (The Arthritis Foundation).
			<p />
			At this time (5 weeks ago) the longest I had run was about 1 mile.
			<p />
			Pauline Noble at work was on the same diet as me, although she is nearly at her ideal weight and has finished the diet program at the gym.  I spoke to Pauline and asked her if she would like to do the run with me.  Unfortunately she said yes and her husband Lee would do it too.
			<p />
			It was stating to look like I couldn't back out.
			<p />
			I thought I would get some sympathetic understanding from Lisa, but she thought is was a good idea too.
			<p />
			Oh dear...
			<p />
			So my training for the run began.
			<p />
			We started running longer distances and running up hills.
			<p />
			Two weeks before the run I brought some new running shoes and entered the run at the shoe shop.  Lisa, James and Abi entered the 1K walk.
			<p />
			At this point the longest I had run was about 1.5 miles.
			<p />
			We continued my training until I tried my first 5K run on the tread mill.  The machine simulated hills and I completed the run in 38 minutes (I had to walk about 5 or 6 times), but I was still relatively pleased.  Everyone kept telling me though that road running was much harder than tread mill running.
			<p />
			I decided I just wanted to complete the run in under 40 minutes, and walk as little as possible.
			<p />
			It was about two weeks before the run that we all realised the date of the run (Sunday 14th December) was the morning after our Christmas party - Oh Dear.
			<p />
			So we went to the party and left at 11pm.
			<p />
			We had agreed to meet Pauline and Lee the following morning in downtown Seattle at the start of the run.
			<p />
			We got up after 5 hours sleep and got the kids ready.  We all had special Jingle Bell sweat shirts to wear.  We were supposed to wear bells too, but I didn't have any.  James however wore his stripy socks with bells on.
			<p />
			We had a quick breakfast and hit the road.
			<p />
			I won't deny I was very nervous about this, I didn't want to look stupid.
			<p />
			We met Pauline and Lee at the start of the run and waited for our wave to get under way.
			<p />
			About 10,000 people were there for the run, it was an amazing sight.
			<p />
			Lisa, James and Abi left for their 1K walk and seemed to get back in no time at all.
			<p />
			Luckily the weather was great, not to cold, dry and sunny.  The only down side was it was very windy.
			<p />
			Oh yeah, the first mile and a half was up hill too.
			<p />
			So finally our wave was called.  We decided to go to the back of our wave so everyone wouldn't be able to overtake us.
			<p />
			The race started and nothing happened.  There were so many people there we couldn't run.  I would guess we were actually about 100 meters from the actual start line and it took us 2 minutes to cross it.
			<p />
			Two things happened as we crossed the line, Lee started his stop watch and we could finally run.
			<p />
			Lee is pretty fit and was going to act as our pace maker.  We didn't want to go too fast (or slow).
			<p />
			I don't know what it was, but the start was great.  There were so many people, and everyone was smiling and laughing.  There was so much to see, the running seemed easy.
			<p />
			The three of us basically ran the 5K.  I had to stop and walk 3 times (the first time was about 1.5 miles in) and each time we walked for no more than 20 seconds.
			<p />
			When we reached the final straight to the finish line we sprinted in and completed the run in 35 minutes.
			<p />
			Not only was I really pleased with myself, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.
			<p />
			We overtook so many people, it felt great.
			<p />
			Again, considering my fitness 5 months ago, it's amazing what I've achieved.
			<p />
			The nice part for me too was Lisa, James and Abi were there at the finish line cheering me on as I crossed.
			<p />
			We enjoyed it so much we are going to run the Seattle St. Patrick's Day 5K and later in the year we are going to attempt a 10K.
			<p />
			I wouldn't say I'm there yet, but I am getting fitter.
