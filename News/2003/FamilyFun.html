			<h2>Family Fun Center</h2>
			Saturday 20th April 2003 (Easter Sunday)
			<p />
			Against my better judgement, today we decided to visit the Family Fun Center.
			<p />
			For those that don't know, this is basically child heaven and parent hell!
			<p />
			The concept goes something like this:
			<ol>
				<li>Get loads of kids in the building with their parents (who have to have cash or a credit card)</li>
				<li>Get the children to badger their parents to spend money on small metal tokens (20 for $5)</li>
				<li>The kids then use the metal tokens in all the games in the building, winning occasional paper tickets (where the better they play the more tickets they get).</li>
				<li>Then offer the kids rubbish toys (usually seconds a poor toy shop couldn't shift) for loads of paper tickets.</li>
				<li>Result: Kids leave happy thinking they have a bargain; Parents leave confused, working out how much that little rubber ball actually cost!</li>
			</ol>
			Anyway, over here the concept is a roaring success and loved by all kids (including James).
			<p />
			So, we arrived for our usual hour (that's all I can stand) of torture.
			<p />
			I was feeling generous as James stated yesterday, everyone in England forgot him over Easter and he didn't get any eggs (Nikki you are of course excused from this :-).  The effect (well done James) was that Lisa and I felt terrible.
			<p />
			So, $20 later and 90 tokens in his hand, we headed for the games machines.
			<p />
			The trips to the Family Fun Center always go the same way.  James wants to play stupid games that give one ticket per token.  Lisa and I want to play the "Win 25 tickets for one token by just performing a small miracle" games.
			<p />
			The inevitable happens, we fight over tokens.  Lisa and James of course win, so I spend another $5 so I can prove how clever I am and win the most tickets.
			<p />
			As usual James and Lisa have the most fun, I get into a fight with a 8 year old because he's hogging the best machine of the day.  I usually spend 20 minutes watching the kids to figure out which delivers the most tickets. (Sad eh?)
			<p />
			Anyway, we were in there for the allowed hour, and today got an all time record of 770 tickets, beating our previous best 265 by a massive amount (and lots more $ I should say).
			<p />
			Before we choose to trade in our tickets, we decide (James decides) to play mini golf.  Apparently I promised.
			<p />
			Mini golf is nearly as painful as the gaming machines, as James has to win.  Of course he never does, it's usually Lisa or I and I should say we are both far too competitive about it.  But of course we always tell James he wins.
			<p />
			James must be living in denial, as he knows he uses more strokes than Lisa or I and usually looses each hole, but he still believes me when I tell him he wins.  It's only a matter of time before he finds out and hates me forever.
			<p />
			Lisa chose not to play today (I think she could tell I was on form and bottled out :-), claiming she didn't feel up to it being 38 weeks pregnant.  What an excuse!!!
			<p />
			As usual James wins :-)
			<p />
			We then took some pictures of the other outside activities, fun boating, trampolining, baseball and softball nets and go carts.
			<p />
			Then we went inside to spend our tickets.
			<p />
			James wanted to use them to get 50 rubber balls (or something like that), but as he had over 700, we convinced him to get a new basket ball (700 tickets).
			<p />
			He had 70 left so got a small rubber thing (don't know how to describe it), an alien (with red eyes) key fob and a plastic plane (that he broke in the car leaving the car park).
			<p />
			Result: James left happy, I worked out his ball, thing, alien and broken plane cost $31.
			<p />
			I have included numerous pictures of the day out, including a James Self Portrait!!!! (Uncle Alex would be proud*)
			<p />
			(* Explanation required: My brother Alex has a habit of pinching your camera when you're not looking to take a ridiculous self portrait.  James thinks this is great and has decided to continue the family tradition.)
