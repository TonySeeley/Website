			<h2>Sonics</h2>
			Sunday 14th December 2003
			<p />
			In September James joined the cub scouts.  The cubs here in the states are very different from the cubs I remember.  Mind you I was only a cub for about 3 weeks, just long enough for my Dad to buy all the gear before they chucked me out.  Apparently, they don't like you digging up the scout hut with a pen knife.
			<p />
			Anyway that's enough about me.
			<p />
			James is currently a Tiger Cub.  He wears an orange tee-shirt and hat and a belt with beads. All very strange.  Anyway he really likes it so it's all fine with me.
			<p />
			Something else that's very different is the family involvement.
			<p />
			James has to do certain tasks to win beads and then badges.  Some examples are; create a food pyramid (don't ask me), create a marshmallow snowman, maintain a den scrap book, go on a hike, visit the flight museum and go to a sports event.
			<p />
			On some of these tasks, the family (i.e. me) has to attend.
			<p />
			It was decided by his den leader that the best sporting event they should attend was basketball.  As a game doesn't last too long.
			<p />
			As a result we all went to see the Seattle Super Sonics basketball team play at Seattle Key Arena.
			<p />
			I should point out that the game was 2 hours after the Jingle Bell Run, which was 5 hours after our office Christmas party, so Lisa and I were really looking forward to it.
			<p />
			We arrived at Key Arena with about 10 minutes to spare, parking was dead easy and we found our seats in no time.
			<p />
			Most of James' den were already there waiting for the game to start.
			<p />
			As none of us had ever been to a basketball game before we didn't know what to expect.
			<p />
			Yeah, sure, we knew there would be very tall guys running around bouncing a ball, but we didn't know the rules, how long a game lasted or what happened at half time etc.
			<p />
			Our seats were very high up (they were cheap ones), but we could see really well.
			<p />
			We had remembered to bring binoculars with us but James wouldn't let go, so he had a great view.
			<p />
			The game was broken up into 4 quarters, each lasting 12 minutes.  However, each team can call a timeout whenever they want (although they have a maximum number to use up - we don't know what this number is).
			<p />
			Every time a timeout is called or a quarter ends, all these blokes dressed up in animal costumes run onto the court and entertain the crowd.
			<p />
			The entertainment usually consists of some sort of competition between the said animal blokes, but as the primary mascot for the Sonics is a sassquatch called Squatch he usually wins.
			<p />
			Other forms of entertainment include picking on the referees, something the audience seem to love.
			<p />
			At half time, a wrestling ring was brought on and a bout between all the animal blokes ensued.  Guess who won?  Yup, Squatch, much to the delight of all the kids in the audience.
			<p />
			Later on, I can't remember if it was third quarter or a time out, a trampette was brought out and the afore mentioned animal blokes bounced on it and got baskets.  In truth, they were quite entertaining.
			<p />
			Oh yeah, and the basketball was good too.  And we won.  Which was nice.
			<p />
			In truth, it was fun, but I am writing this at midnight on a Sunday and want to go to bed.  So if you want all the details ask me later.
