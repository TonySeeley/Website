			<h2>Holiday in England</h2>
			15th - 24th August 2003
			<p />
			After eight months in the US we decided (actually Lisa decided) it was time to visit the UK.
			<p />
			Lisa wanted the family to meet Abi and also wanted to see her new nieces (her sister Tracey gave birth to twin girls Jana and Madeline on July 2nd).
			<p />
			I was terrified about the flight; I was not looking forward to ten hours in a plane with James and Abi.  However, they were both fantastic. Abi slept for the whole flight and James watched films and read.  It was a dream :-)
			<p />
			We decided to spend one part of the holiday in Wokingham, spending time with Lisa's family and seeing our friends and then go up to Warwick and visit my sister and get my family to join us all there.
			<p />
			Our first night in England we visited Sue and Nick, who very kindly offered us their house while they were away on vacation.  They weren't leaving until the following day so we booked into the Coppid Beech hotel for the first night.
			<p />
			I found out on day one the real reason Lisa wanted to go to England - "Marks and Spencer".  For those that don't know, Marks and Spencer is Lisa's favorite shop, and I think everyone knows how Lisa feels about shopping.
			<p />
			So, we went to Marks and Spencer, Next, Marks and Spencer, Tesco's and Marks and Spencer. This was turning out to be a great holiday.
			<p />
			In between trips to the shops, we visited Lisa's sister Nikki and saw Craig, Jordan and Regan, along with Tracey, Ria, Jana and Madeline.
			<p />
			Lisa's mum Janet and dad Roger tuned up and we enjoyed a great family reunion.
			<p />
			Saturday night Lisa's mum babysat while Lisa and I went out to the pub and met up with Karen, Sam, Dexter and Jane.  It was a great evening, even though I was on water all night.
			<p />
			On Sunday we drove over to Reading to see Karen and David and also met up with Mel and Ed.
			<p />
			We decided to visit Crowthorne, the village we used to live in, and went to see Helen, Jack and Millie.  We did drive past our old house but didn't see any of the neighbours.  We did pop in to see Karen Preston and Joe and Emily which was lovely.
			<p />
			So back to Marks and Spencer :-)
			<p />
			Wednesday was James' birthday, so we went with his cousins to Legoland.
			<p />
			The day after James' birthday Nikki organized a birthday party at her house.  This was to enable James to invite his UK friends (and have a third birthday celebration - Oh to be six again...)
			<p />
			All of Lisa's family attended and my brother Alex came along.  Sam and Karen also joined us with Karen's two gorgeous daughters, Georgia and Olivia.
			<p />
			Heidi brought along Elliott and his sister Catherine, one of James' friends from his old school. And it was great to see Lisa B again too.
			<p />
			In fact there were loads of kids there - most of whom I don't know (or can't remember) so sorry about that - I was chatting up Sam and Karen :-)
			<p />
			Nikki had ordered a bouncy slide for the KIDS to play on, and as usual Lisa felt the need to help kids slide down (at least I think that's what she was doing).
			<p />
			Nikki had also got James a birthday cake (another one), so he had another great day along with more prezzies (to take home on the plane).
			<p />
			The only bad part of the party, (bad for me that is, everyone else thought it was hysterical) was that while sitting outside, boring everyone with my phenomenal slimming success and dieting skill (which is pretty impressive by the way), I accidentally broke my chair.  When I say broke, it collapsed with me sitting on it.  Fortunately (dam) someone (I think Tracey - who is not on my list of favorite people right now) took a photograph.  And being a true and fair recorder of the day's activities, I have included it on this page. (Thanks Tracey!)
			<p />
			The following morning we were travelling up to Warwick, so after the party we made our tearful goodbyes and returned to Sue and Nick's house for our last night in Wokingham.
			<p />
			The following morning, after tidying up Sue and Nick's house (I thought I was on holiday) we left for Warwick.
			<p />
			We arrived at Jane's house and saw both Jane and Gerry (Jane's husband) and awaited the arrival of the rest of the Seeley clan.
			<p />
			The following day, Alex (brother), Katie (sister) with her partner Neil and son Charlie, Aimee (niece - Jane's daughter) and partner Phil all arrived.  Later on my Dad (Gerald) and step-mum (Chris) arrived too.
			<p />
			We had loads of fun showing off Abi and enjoyed a beautiful day in the garden.
			<p />
			Charlie taught us all how to play ring-a-ring-of-roses and particularly enjoyed the all-fall-down part.
			<p />
			Dad and Chris left late afternoon and in the evening we all played "Absolute Balderdash" which was great fun.  I found out my family have bizarre imaginations (so that's where I get it...)
			<p />
			We finally all crashed out at Jane's after a very long day.
			<p />
			The following day was Sunday and time to leave.
			<p />
			Again we made our tearful goodbyes and left for the airport.
			<p />
			Again I was dreading the flight home, but was pleasantly surprised with James and Abi who were again both fantastic.  I think Abi slept for eight of the nine hours in the air.
			<p />
			We arrived home in Redmond Sunday night, completely exhausted but so pleased we visited England.
			<p />
			We decided, (until Lisa changes her mind that is) that we will spend our vacation next year traveling around the US.  So no UK visits until 2005, when we should have two family weddings Aimee and Phil, and Katie and Neil. :-)
			<p />
			So until then, thanks to everyone for making our holiday great fun.  We really enjoyed visiting and wished it could have been longer (especially at Jane's house).
			<p />
			So unless you visit us, see you in 2005 :-)
