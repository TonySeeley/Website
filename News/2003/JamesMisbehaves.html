			<h2>James Misbehaves</h2>
			Friday 23rd May 2003
			<p />
			It's taken me a couple of days to cool down to the point where I can post this story.
			<p />
			Everyone keeps telling me that I will eventually find this funny - personally I can't see that day arriving!
			<p />
			Last Wednesday (21st May), we were invited to our local community hall for a community induction meeting.
			<p />
			This was run by Pat, a representative of the community committee, who told us things like, where our community dues go, what are the community annual events and reminded us of what we can and can't do!!! - Which was nice.
			<p />
			Anyway, there where a number of families present, some with children.  All the kids were given balloons to play with and were running riot around the presenter.
			<p />
			Pat suggested the kids move next door, where there was plenty of room for them to run around etc. Although she did point out several times, 'she did love kids', it was becoming apparent she wanted to kill them all as they were ruining her slick (ha) presentation.
			<p />
			So, we sent the 3 nosiest, disruptive kids next door.  James, and a smaller boy and girl who took a liking to him and started following him around.
			<p />
			Over the next 30 minutes, during the presentation, the kids played chase, and we heard them laughing as they popped all the balloons.
			<p />
			Then things went quiet.  (Warning bells should have gone off)
			<p />
			Five minutes later, James comes through looking thoroughly rejected, head held low etc.  I though he was going to cry!!  Anyway he sidles up to me and whispers "I have paint on my Top".
			<p />
			He turned around and, sure enough, loads of paint over his back.
			<p />
			Being me, I took the news in my stride - actually I think I screamed "Oh No", jumped up and ran next door.  (Those who know me even remotely know I NEVER run)
			<p />
			I can't begin to describe what I found, but I'll give it a try!
			<p />
			Toys were everywhere, buckets and buckets of toys had been pulled out of previously closed cupboards and tipped upside down.
			<p />
			The floor (carpeted) was covered in paint, as were the five tables in the room.
			<p />
			The two smaller kids (I would guess ages 4 and 3) were very busy rubbing paint from different coloured tubes into the two biggest tables as fast as they could.  They were both completely covered in paint also.
			<p />
			It was truly unbelievable.
			<p />
			The room looked like it had been vandalized.
			<p />
			James just stood there, next to me looking at his feet.
			<p />
			After what seemed like minutes (probably 30 seconds - it took that long to register) - I shut my mouth, and ran to the toilets.
			<p />
			I grabbed loads of hand towels and a bowl of warm water from the kitchen, continually muttering "I don't believe it, I don't believe it".
			<p />
			I guess curiosity got the better of the other parents (watching this mad man run around next door with buckets of water) and they all came to look.
			<p />
			It took us probably 30 minutes to clear everything up, Lisa, a neighbour and I did most of the work, the mother of the other two kids did very little (which made me even madder).
			<p />
			We washed all the tables, the toys that were covered in paint, even washed some walls (yes walls) and the carpet trying to get the paint out.
			<p />
			We then put all the toys away.
			<p />
			Not surprisingly, James can't quite remember who started it, or who got the paints out and why he didn't come and get me immediately the other two got out of hand.
			<p />
			Knowing James I can guess what happened.  He probably, opened all the cupboards, found the paint and toys, joined in for a short while and realized "Oh God, this is not good I'm in the $&amp;!t".  But then stood there deciding what to do for 2 more minutes.
			<p />
			I just can't believe it.  I keep saying he's old enough to know better, but then Lisa reminds me how I was the same age when I walked up a neighbours drive way through freshly laid concrete, watching my foot steps as I went, directly behind the guy laying the concrete etc. etc.
			<p />
			I was also older (8 I think) when I thought it would be fun to through stones over the 10 foot hedge at the bottom of the garden and listen to the green house glass breaking next door.
			<p />
			Basically her argument is, "I was horrid" and "we are lucky James hasn't done anything else like this before already" - and "that this will probably happen again", "and again", "and again" ...
			<p />
			So, James gets no pocket money for a month, no play dates (that's American for friends round our house or him going to their house) for a month, and no gifts, toys or souvenirs etc. when we visit all the local tourist attractions next week with his cousins.
			<p />
			Oh yeah, I am out $100+ too.  I offered to pay for the cleaning of the carpet ($97.03) and to replace the paints.  The other parent offered NOTHING!!
			<p />
			Oh to be a parent...
			<p />
			One last thing I have to say at the bottom of this posting is:
			<p />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry Dad, I get it now.
