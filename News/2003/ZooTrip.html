			<h2>Woodland Park Zoo</h2>
			Saturday 19th April 2003
			<p />
			As we only have two weeks before Abi's arrival, we decided to have a day out.
			<p />
			James is currently doing a project at school on Tigers, and two female Tiger cubs were recently born at Woodland Park Zoo.  As a result, it seemed a good idea to go and check them out.
			<p />
			In fact a local TV news channel is running a vote to name the two cubs, the possible names are below (along with there English meanings).
			<p />
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td width="20">&nbsp;</td>
					<td width="150">Molek (beautiful)</td>
					<td>Indah (beautiful)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>&nbsp;</td>
					<td>Suriya (sun)</td>
					<td>Langka (rare)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>&nbsp;</td>
					<td>Jaya (freedom)</td>
					<td>Mulia (noble)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>&nbsp;</td>
					<td>Kasih (love)</td>
					<td>Malu (shy)</td>
				</tr>

			Lisa has also been quite poorly recently, she has had a bad cold and her temperature even soared to 101.5 F, and with the baby so close we were a little scared.  As she was feeling better, a day out was called for.
			<p />
			We arrived at the zoo about 1:30pm as Lisa wouldn't get up and James wouldn't get off the Game-Cube.  (I was very busy tidying the house etc. etc.)
			<p />
			When we arrived at the zoo, we thought we would make our way quickly to the Tiger enclosure so we could see the cubs first.  However, when we arrived, we were told by a fat ugly female zoo keeper that the queue was 40 minutes, and the cubs were only on show until 2pm.  As a result we wouldn't make it.
			<p />
			We were obviously very upset, but decided to make the best of the day and see all the other animals.
			<p />
			20 minutes later, the cub queue was still there, and still as long, and a nice portly gentleman who worked at the zoo told us the exhibit would be open longer to satisfy the demand.  I wanted to go and find the ugly one, but Lisa wouldn't let me, so we queued.  And queued.  And queued some more.
			<p />
			Finally we got in and saw the beautiful tigress mother (called JoJo) asleep in her cage (she was really close too).  The two cubs however, where hiding behind a log and we couldn't see them very well at all.  (It was at this point we decided we didn't like tigers!!!)
			<p />
			We continued round the zoo, James had a massive ice cream (that he didn't eat), and found a hill that apparently HAD to be rolled down.
			<p />
			The zoo also had a Family Petting Zoo corner, were the kids all made animal masks.  We arrived 5 minutes before it closed but James insisted he could colour in and cut out a wolf's mask.  15 minutes later we were asked to leave the 'discovery' hut, complete with finished wolf!
			<p />
			One nice point of the day was the gorillas.  A baby gorilla was born late last year and we got a great view of the baby with its mother.
			<p />
			We saw loads of animals and all had a great time.  James got some good pictures for his school project and even felt a tigers pelt.
			<p />
			Stupidly, I promised James I would take him somewhere tomorrow too, so expect another posting Monday morning. (Although I might not be able to get up tomorrow :-)
