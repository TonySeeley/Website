			<h2>Easter Egg Hunt</h2>
			Saturday 5th April 2003
			<p />
			Last Saturday our community centre held an Easter Egg Hunt for all the children in the area.
			<p />
			James reluctantly went along, spurned on only by the thought of free chocolate. In fact when we got there, all the grounds around the community centre were literary covered in eggs. Before everyone in England goes "Oh God how unhygienic", the eggs where plastic containers holding sweets and chocolate. On seeing this James' spirits rose.
			<p />
			Inside the community centre, kids were decorating paper bags (to hold their horde of sweets), eating bagels and getting their face painted.
			<p />
			James decided he did not want to do any of this, however we made him!
			<p />
			He spent about 15 minutes arguing over what to draw on his paper bag and after 15 minutes of colouring in a few Easter eggs only to find he had missed the hunt!
			<p />
			We did think it was quiet inside at the time, and found this was because all the other kids (about 150 of them) had sneaked outside and pinched all the eggs.
			<p />
			Poor James didn't get one. (And there really were hundreds) We saw children walking off with their parents carrying 10 eggs each.
			<p />
			James accepted his fate like a true Seeley (and sulked for 20 minutes), we did however convince him to get his face painted. He chose a Lizard and a Killer Whale.
			<p />
			I have included some pictures of the day so you can see what it was like :-)
			<p />
			We even made him pose with a 6 foot Easter bunny - he was NOT amused.
			<p />
			Anyway to cheer James up, we went out and brought a bag of 24 plastic eggs and filled them with sweets. Lisa then hid them all round the house, and James found and scoffed the lot within 10 minutes.
			<p />
			The end of a perfect day...
