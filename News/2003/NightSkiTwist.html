			<h2>Night Skiing with a Twist!</h2>
			Tuesday 30th December 2003
			<p />
			A number of people from work have recently discovered the joys of night skiing.  We leave work a little early and drive up to the slopes at the Summit and ski for a few hours.
			<p />
			It's hard to describe why it's such fun, you really have to try it, but the snow slopes somehow look differently at night.  The artificial light actually makes it easier to see the slopes' lines.  On top of that, it's not that busy (no major queues) so we can get back on the chair lift quickly.  I think the real draw for me is I always feel like a character in a James Bond movie flying down the slopes in the dark escaping capture (but then I'm a sad romantic figure with too much imagination).
			<p />
			This particular night though had an unusual end - hence the account on the web site.
			<p />
			David Dennis had called me Monday morning to see if I fancied a night ski the following day (Tuesday 30th December).  I phoned around to try and drum up more interest and convinced Evan and Sally Morgans to join us.
			<p />
			So Tuesday evening we left for the slopes just after 4pm.  Just under an hour later we were on our first ski run at Summit Central.
			<p />
			The snow was fantastic; it had that squeaky quality that's just fun to ski on.  On top of that, visibility was perfect, the temperature was not too bad and it wasn't snowing.
			<p />
			We skied for a few hours stopping in the middle to grab a bite to eat.  Around 9pm it started to snow and we decided, as the cloud was rolling in, to call it a night.
			<p />
			We quickly got back to our cars (I was in David's car), said our goodbyes and headed for home.
			<p />
			Most of the journey home was uneventful; the snow however was now coming down pretty fast.
			<p />
			We had stopped for gas in North Bend and were almost home.  In fact, we were about 2 miles from home when the fun really started.
			<p />
			It was around 11pm and we were just about to enter Redmond Ridge, the snow was still coming down hard and David and I were discussing work.
			<p />
			All of a sudden the back of the car went into a bad skid to the left.  In David's defence he was driving under thirty and I think was just very unlucky.  He turned into the skid and (I think) out of panic hit the brakes. It was probably the brakes that got us, as the car spun and headed for the side of the road.
			<p />
			I should point out here there was a big ditch (about eight feet deep) at the side of the road.  The car went into a roll and we ended upside down at the bottom of the ditch.
			<p />
			David immediately asked if I was OK, and I asked if he was hurt.  Luckily we were both OK.  His side window had shattered when we rolled and there was a large crack in the windscreen.  So we were both covered in glass.
			<p />
			I had banged the top of my arm during the roll and David had hit his head. But fortunately nothing bad for either of us.
			<p />
			So there we were, hanging upside down, the car almost on its side, David was higher up than me and leaning on me too.  David found his phone and chose to call Linda first.  We joked about this later, when I asked why he called Linda before 911.  He didn't really know, but said he thought she might be worried.
			<p />
			Linda called Lisa after we hung up and we called 911.
			<p />
			David then spent 5 minutes arguing with the lady on the phone about where we were.  It was so funny, he kept saying "Can I call you back as we are upside down" and she replied with, "but you must have been heading east not north".  Out of frustration David hung up on her and we decided to escape the car.
			<p />
			I unbuckled first (as I was below David) and stood up (or at least tried to). I managed to open his driver's door but couldn't get out as he was in the way and my feet kept slipping on the windscreen.
			<p />
			So David took off his belt and climbed out while I opened the door.  (We didn't want to climb out of the window as there was a lot of broken glass around the edges).
			<p />
			Once out, David held the door for me and I climbed out.
			<p />
			Just before I climbed out a car passed, and even slowed a little before continuing.  I think I shouted something like "Thanks for stopping".  I felt quite bad once out, as the car turned round and came back.
			<p />
			It was this driver who told us the street name so David re-called 911.
			<p />
			We had started laughing by now and found everything very funny.  I think we were just happy to be able to walk away.
			<p />
			David's call this time went much better and we were told a police officer was on his way.
			<p />
			The snow was really coming down now, so we threw a couple of snowballs at the car.
			<p />
			Two other cars stopped and asked if we were OK, which was really nice.  We told them we were OK, but told them to drive slowly.
			<p />
			As we had nothing to do (and neither of us were wearing coats) we decided to raid the car of all our stuff.
			<p />
			We got out our ski equipment and suitable coats, hats and gloves.
			<p />
			It was about this time that the police turned up.  Andrew was his name - nice guy too - apart from his taste in music :-)
			<p />
			He asked us what happened and asked David for License, Registration and Insurance documents (things that you have to carry at all times in the US in the car).
			<p />
			David said, "Ahh this could be problematic, my license is at home, I'm waiting for my pink slip from California to re-register the car as I lost my copy, and, oh yeah, the temporary registration is out of date.  And I am in the process of changing my insurance and I haven't got the insurance card yet - the guy couldn't get his fax to work" (Things didn't look good).
			<p />
			The police officer looked at us like we were from another planet, because I kept laughing and David had a huge smile on his face as he delivered his monologue.
			<p />
			Andrew then asked David for all his details and wrote everything down.  I had to give him my license and he went to his patrol car to check us out.
			<p />
			He also asked us if we were hurt, we said we were OK but he called out the paramedics just in case.
			<p />
			Andrew asked if we wanted to sit in the back of his patrol car (it was still snowing really hard).  We said we just wanted to walk around for a bit.  So while Andrew called the tow truck we threw some more snowballs at the car (he must have thought we were mad!)
			<p />
			After about ten minutes we decided to get in his car, it was really cold out side and it looked like we were going to be there for a while.
			<p />
			Once in the back of the car, David asked Andrew if he was going to get a citation (due to not having any docs), Andrew very kindly said he would let him off.  David then went in to great detail of how he was driving too fast and how bad a driver he was.  I kept elbowing him and telling him to shut up, I could see a citation coming his way any second.  Luckily Andrew thought we were funny (or really stupid) and let it all go.
			<p />
			About then the paramedics turned up, in a fire engine (cool).  David and I were both interviewed and told we were probably OK and our injuries didn't justify a trip to the hospital.  The fire engine left us and we returned to the back of Andrew's car.
			<p />
			For the next hour we listened to terrible country and western music on the radio and Andrew's police band radio.  In Andrew's defence he asked us if we wanted to listen to another station, but for some weird reason we both said no (I don't know why).
			<p />
			Anyway, the police band radio was much more interesting.  The number of accidents was unbelievable.  The funny thing was we heard a police car had also just driven into a ditch.
			<p />
			After about an hour (and numerous calls to find out where the tow truck was) Andrew told us he had to leave us as there were so many accidents taking place and we seemed to be ok.
			<p />
			He left us two flares and drove off.  We were well wrapped up and talked by the side of the road, played with snowballs again, and even considered putting our skis and snowboards on for a little fun, when the tow truck turned up.
			<p />
			The driver was a big bearded guy called Kim, who at first looked like he knew what he was doing - looks clearly are deceiving.
			<p />
			Kim's first job was to get the car out of the ditch; both David and I were really interested in how he was going to go about this.  One of us asked Kim and he said something like, "Oh we look for something sturdy to pull on, on the bottom of the car".  It was about now we started to have concerns.
			<p />
			Kim spent the next 40 minutes trying to attach some chains to the bottom of the car, then he spent ages trying to position his truck to start pulling out David's car.
			<p />
			He finally got ready to pull, and attached the winch to the chains.
			<p />
			Then he started to winch in the cable.  He had forgotten however to drop the winch supports at the back on his truck and his truck started to slide backwards.
			<p />
			Kim dropped the winch support and tried again.
			<p />
			It wasn't working though; apparently something was wrong with the truck. Some switch was stuck (or something), Kim kept kicking his truck and complaining about his employer's damaged equipment.  At one point he even tried to telephone someone back at his yard for advice on the broken kit.
			<p />
			In frustration Kim stopped for a 10 minute cigarette break.  David and I were in hysterics, and we had even started laying bets on what would and wouldn't work next.
			<p />
			After his break, Kim decided to try again, amazingly, very slowly he pulled the car out of the ditch on it's roof.
			<p />
			He was now completely blocking the road with his truck and David's car behind.
			<p />
			He unhooked the winch and tried to drive his truck to be alongside the car so he would be able to turn the car over.
			<p />
			Unfortunately, even though his truck had chains on the back wheels, it wouldn't turn.
			<p />
			The funny thing was, there was another ditch on the other side of the road and he was in danger of falling in that one himself.
			<p />
			He started edging forward and backwards trying to turn, when I asked David if Kim should have raised the winch support that was now dragging on the floor. We both decided not to say anything as Kim was the professional and probably knew what he was doing. (We were very wrong).
			<p />
			After about 20 forward and backward manoeuvres, Kim had successfully turned his truck round so it was facing the wrong way.  He proceeded to drive down the road to turn around and even turned into someone's drive to provide enough room to do a three point turn.  When he tried to reverse it became very apparent that the winch support being left down was a mistake.
			<p />
			Kim climbed out of his cab (swearing and shouting) and raised the support.
			<p />
			David and I totally lost it at this time and couldn't even look at him any more - we were almost crying with laughter.
			<p />
			Eventually Kim got his truck positioned next to the car to allow him to turn it over (remember the car was still upside down).
			<p />
			Kim then got out all his chains again.
			<p />
			He spent another 40 minutes trying to attach the chains to the car.  His plan was to use his two winches to pull the far corner wheels towards him, thus turning the car.  Unfortunately one of the winches was jammed, so his plan fell apart.
			<p />
			It was at this time that he told us that after he got us home, he was going to quit his job. :-)
			<p />
			He tried to turn the car by pulling one wheel, both David and I said the car would spin, and sure enough that's what started to happen.
			<p />
			This was starting to drive us mad; in the end we stepped in and started giving advice on how to pull both wheels with one winch.  Kim said that was his next plan (yeah right).
			<p />
			After another 20 minutes (and another smoke break) Kim was ready to try again.  He had made so many attempts where the chains had come off the car as the winch was pulled, we thought he was never going to right the car.
			<p />
			This time he was successful and David and I broke into a round of applause.
			<p />
			Kim disconnected and stowed all the chains and moved his truck in front of the car to hitch it up for towing.
			<p />
			We were a bit concerned he was going to push the car back into the ditch, so I shouted directions as he reversed.
			<p />
			He hitched the car to the truck and was about to drive off when I noticed the back tyre (that was still on the ground) had come off the wheel.  I asked if he wanted us to put the spare wheel on (it was 2am and we were tired). But Kim said no, he had some equipment that would handle that later.
			<p />
			We were completely blocking the road and some guy pulls up, gets out of his car and asks if we can move the truck.  We all looked at him like he was a loony, and basically said no.  I think the question frustrated David more than me, because David said something like, "Get lost man, we rolled the car and it's taken us hours to get this far".  The guy and David's conversation started to spiral downhill, I actually thought at one point it was going to come to blows!
			<p />
			Eventually the guy got in his car, screamed some abuse at us and sped back in the direction he came from sliding all over the road.  David, Kim and I were all chanting, "Roll in a ditch, Roll in a ditch".  Unfortunately he disappeared over the hill without incident.
			<p />
			Now was the time for Kim to prove his worth and point the truck and car uphill.  Oh dear...
			<p />
			He tried to turn the truck, but kept slipping, in fact he was again close to driving over the edge on the other side of the road.
			<p />
			We thought we were never going to get away, the more Kim tried to turn, the more he actually straightened up, making it harder and harder.
			<p />
			Kim was also starting to get annoyed, and I could actually see him loosing it and driving over the edge.
			<p />
			Things were looking bleak, until a white knight appeared.  His name was Evan and he drove a Chevy with a winch.
			<p />
			It was amazing, he just pulled over and offered to help. What a guy.  He basically attached his winch to Kim's tow truck and winched in the truck while Kim tried to turn.
			<p />
			At first it didn't work, in fact, when Evan turned on the winch first time, his Chevy just slipped towards Kim's tow truck.
			<p />
			Evan had to move his truck twice to actually get Kim's tow truck to turn enough to straighten up.  It was very close at one point, we all thought Kim was going to drive over the edge, but in the end we made it.
			<p />
			David and I thought we were home and dry, things were looking good, however we had forgotten about the rear tyre.
			<p />
			Both David and I loaded up his car with all the stuff we had removed (there was no room on the tow truck) and climbed in the cab ready for the trip home.
			<p />
			Kim however started unloading loads of kit to raise the back of David's car onto a makeshift trailer.
			<p />
			This took about 30 minutes.  By the time we lost patience and got out of the cab to ask what was going on, Kim was packing everything away again.
			<p />
			Apparently the equipment didn't work (what a surprise).  It looked like that spare was going to have to be put on the car after all.
			<p />
			Kim was really embarrassed and suggested driving us home with the car tyre hanging off and said he would change the tyre later.  We were past caring and agreed, it was now 3am.
			<p />
			So we climbed back into the cab and drove the last 2 miles home.  Kim and David dropped me off first and then went on to David's house.
			<p />
			I spoke to David the following day and found out that Kim dropped off David, but returned 30 minutes later and woke up David and Linda by ringing the doorbell.  Apparently he had forgotten to give David his paperwork.
			<p />
			So that was our ski night.
			<p />
			Fun at the beginning, scary in the middle, and hysterical in the end.
			<p />
			Skiing's a bit like life really ...
