			<h2>Jordan & Regan Visit</h2>
			Friday 23rd May 2003 - Monday 2nd June 2003
			<p />
			Before I start describing the week we all had together I need to explain about the cheeky boys.
			<p />
			For those that don't know (probably only Americans who read this) in the first series of Pop Idol in the UK, (American Idol is the US equivalent), two sisters auditioned who called themselves the cheeky girls.
			<p />
			Monica and Gabriela Irimia performed their song called "Touch My Bum" that was written by their mother.  The sisters came from Transylvania and performed their song and dance (yes dance) for the judges.
			<p />
			Basically, they didn't get through to the next round, but were signed independently and had a UK hit with "Touch My Bum".
			<p />
			Why am I telling you all this?
			<p />
			Well, Regan has perfected the dance and performed it everywhere throughout the week (and I mean everywhere).
			<p />
			James immediately caught on and joined him whenever possible.
			<p />
			Regan's older brother Jordan however, is just too old and sensible to be caught out doing a silly dance in public.  I did get them all to perform the dance however, I told them they had to do it to get into "Family Fun Center".
			<p />
			Anyway, here's what we did.
			<p />
			<u>The Space Needle</u>
			<p />
			We all visited the Space Needle, they boys loved it.  The best bit for them however was going to the funfair at the base of the Needle.
			<p />
			They all went on the roller coaster 3 times.
			<p />
			Regan performed the CheekyBoy dance on the large round rocks out side the Needle.
			<p />
			<u>Seattle Aquarium</u>
			<p />
			We visited the Seattle Aquarium.  The boys all liked the exhibits, Regan especially enjoyed dressing up as a scuba diver.
			<p />
			They saw the sea otters being fed and the touch pools where they could handle starfish and sea anemones.  However, Regan was the only boy brave enough to put his hands on the water.  Way to go Regan.
			<p />
			Oh yeah and Regan did the CheekyBoy dance in the sea horse exhibit.
			<p />
			<u>Woodland Park Zoo</u>
			<p />
			At Woodland Park Zoo we met up with David and Linda Dennis and their children Jacob and Amaya.
			<p />
			The kids all got along famously and the 4 boys played well.
			<p />
			After the monkey exhibit all the boys decided they wanted to be monkeys and we got some nice photos.
			<p />
			Amaya was wonderful as she had got a monkey mask and decided to scare everyone.  We had a lot of fun in the park playing with the kids.
			<p />
			Regan performed the CheekyBoy dance all over the zoo.
			<p />
			<u>Pacific Science Center / Children's Museum</u>
			<p />
			Lisa took Nikki and the boys to the Pacific Science Center and the Children's Museum.  I couldn't join them as I had to work that day.
			<p />
			The boys as usual had a great time.
			<p />
			<u>Elliot Bay Harbour Tour</u>
			<p />
			We went down to the harbour and went out into Elliot Bay on one of the Argosy tours.  It was great and the boys loved it.
			<p />
			James and Regan performed the CheekyBoy dance on the main deck.
			<p />
			<u>Family Fun Center</u>
			<p />
			We took the boys to the Family Fun Center and they couldn't wait to get in.  As they were so keen we made them all (including a very reluctant Jordan) perform the CheekyBoy dance outside.  Which I videoed.  It's amazing what kids will do to get into that place!
			<p />
			This was (for the boys) the best place to visit.
			<p />
			They had a blast.  Regan and James went on trampolines.  Then all three boys went out on small motor boats that squirted water.
			<p />
			They all got soaked, although I suspect the fact that Lisa and Nikki where squirting them from the side helped.  We then played mini golf and finally went inside to play on all the machines.
			<p />
			After two and a half hours of adult hell (and kid rapture) we all left with bags of toys (rubbish).
			<p />
			<u>Bellevue Mall</u>
			<p />
			The trip wasn't just for the boys however.  Nikki needed some entertaining too.  So we took her to Bellevue Mall.  Needless to say she liked it (well she would wouldn't she - after all she's Lisa's sister!).
			<p />
			<u>South Center Mall</u>
			<p />
			Why stop at one mall so we went to South Center.  She liked it there too.
			<p />
			As you can imagine this was torture for the boys.  Luckily they discovered Starbucks Vanilla Frappacchino's which kept them quiet for 10 minutes.
			<p />
			<u>Redmond Town Center</u>
			<p />
			Being a woman, Nikki wasn't quite shopped out so we went to Redmond town center too.
			<p />
			The major draw for the boys here is the fact that there is a Cold Stone Creamery.  For those who don't know, this is a shop where you go in and buy some of their home made ice cream and pick what ever mix ins you fancy.
			<p />
			The order was always the same:
			<p />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Chocolate - triple gummy bears (Regan)
			<p />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Mint - triple gummy bears (Jordan)
			<p />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Strawberry - triple gummy bears (James)
			<p />
			The boys would polish off their ice creams while the girls went shopping.
			<p />
			Near the end of the week, the boys wanted to investigate the shopping area too and found (after their ice creams) three fountains.  On seeing the fountains Regan took off his clothes (left his shorts on) and ran in.  I have never seen anyone get undressed so fast.
			<p />
			James and Jordan soon followed.
			<p />
			They all got soaked.
			<p />
			I meant to say - Regan performed the CheekyBoy dance in Gap and in the fountain.
			<p />
			<u>Kirkland</u>
			<p />
			One day (another with fantastic weather) we went down to Kirkland on Lake Washington.
			<p />
			It was really nice, the boys paddled in the lake and skimmed stones.
			<p />
			<u>Pike Place Market</u>
			<p />
			You can't come to Seattle without visiting Pike Place Market.  So we all went to check it out.
			<p />
			It was a Saturday morning and was heaving with people, so it's amazing we made it through the market with the boys still intact.
			<p />
			<u>Sammamish Lake</u>
			<p />
			On our last full day together we went to Sammamish Lake.  The day was nice and hot so Regan took off all his clothes (everything this time) and went for a swim.
			<p />
			So what else did we all do together?  Well eat mainly.  We visited all our favourite restaurants.  Regan liked TonyRomas best.  I only mention this as he told us every day.
			<p />
			We had a really lovely time together.  It was great fun showing Nikki, Jorgan and Regan around Seattle.
			<p />
			So, after a tearful farewell, Nikki, Jorgan and Regan left.
			<p />
			But oh - what a week!
