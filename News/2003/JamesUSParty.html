			<h2>James US 6th Birthday Party</h2>
			Sunday 10th August 2003
			<p />
			As James was about to leave America for the UK, and he was going to be away for his birthday, he decided he wanted to celebrate his 6th birthday with both his US and UK friends.
			<p />
			Which of course meant two parties.
			<p />
			This tells the story of the American party.
			<p />
			So, we brought a cake (very yummy hot wheels one - chocolate with raspberry filling), cleaned the garage and got ready for the party.
			<p />
			We were going to have the party outside, but Lisa picked a day that had a terrible weather forecast.  So as a result, we decided to hold the party in the garage (hence the bit about cleaning it).
			<p />
			Ironically, it was a lovely day and the sun was out for most of the party.  But never mind I got a clean garage.
			<p />
			We brought some balloons, streamers and party banners to decorate the house and what party could go ahead without a piñata.
			<p />
			"A what" I hear you English people say?
			<p />
			A piñata is basically a cardboard thing (usually animal shaped) that the parent fills with sweets (at great expense) before hanging it up for kids to beat with a large stick.  (Not in the slightest violent eh?)
			<p />
			Anyway, as we are not a violent family (and I will not allow James to have any weapons with which he can beat me with), we got a piñata with string.  The kids all hold one string (there are loads of them) and pull.
			<p />
			One of the strings release the candy.
			<p />
			Safe and still expensive - so successful all round.
			<p />
			This was also in the hot wheels theme and hung from the garage ceiling.
			<p />
			Most kids parties in the US (I say most - the ones James tells me about) have a theme (which costs money).
			<p />
			Our theme (apart from hot wheels) was science.
			<p />
			(This was entirely Lisa's idea - nothing to do with me)
			<p />
			So we had a Mad Science party!!!
			<p />
			Fun and education - what a great mix :-)
			<p />
			This young girl turns up with a car full of chemicals and boxes of science stuff and held the kids attention for a good hour (worth every penny).
			<p />
			I could describe how she explained air pressure and demo'd dry ice, but what really interested me was how she sucked an egg out of a bottle.  (I say interested me, but I was not the only father clapping)
			<p />
			The highlight of the party (apart from the egg trick) was the firing of a rocket.
			<p />
			So as it was a sunny day, we all went outside to set up the rocket.
			<p />
			This took quite some time, as it was a real rocket, with parachute and everything.
			<p />
			Unfortunately, we had three consecutive misfires.
			<p />
			Our mad scientist persevered, and finally managed to fire the rocket a good 300 feet into the air.
			<p />
			As it had taken so long she fired it a second time, much to the delight of the kids.
			<p />
			To finish the day, what could be better than making your own slime (personally I wanted to see the egg trick again, but it wasn't my party).
			<p />
			So all the kids learnt how to make their own slime - lovely.
			<p />
			All that was left was to eat all my food in the house which the children did without effort.
			<p />
			After opening presents, distributing cake and party bags it was over.
			<p />
			England - how can you beat that!
