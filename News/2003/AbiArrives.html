			<h2>Baby Abi Arrives</h2>
			Wednesday 7th May 2003
			<p />
			Today at 7:18pm Lisa gave birth to Abi Jayne Seeley, weighing in at 8 lbs after a 11 hour labour.
			<p />
			Mother and baby (along with father and son) are all doing fine :-)
			<p />
			Lisa had been having a lot of discomfort over the last few days (last 2 weeks really) and it was decided last week to start things moving.
			<p />
			As a result last Wednesday (30th April) Lisa visited the hospital to receive some "Lets get the pregnancy over" treatment.
			<p />
			Result: No Baby.
			<p />
			So Friday morning (2nd May) we went back again.
			<p />
			Result: No Baby.
			<p />
			Finally the hospital decided to admit Lisa to be induced on Sunday night/Monday morning at 12:00am.
			<p />
			We all got excited and expected Abi early Monday morning.
			<p />
			The hospital however phoned us back and said, "Let's make it 7am instead" (clearly Lisa's OB/GYN didn't want to get up that early).
			<p />
			So Monday morning (5th May) at 6am (after no sleep the night before) Lisa and I got up and telephoned the hospital, to be told that they were a bit busy and could we phone back later.
			<p />
			So a just after 7am Lisa phoned again.
			<p />
			"Sorry", we were told, "But 6 expectant mothers had just come in"
			<p />
			!!! THIS BABY WAS NEVER COMING OUT !!!
			<p />
			The hospital this time said they would call us.
			<p />
			So we waited...  and waited...  and waited...
			<p />
			Finally, we got a call at 1:30pm (on Monday) and were told we could go in... some time Tuesday, probably midnight!!!
			<p />
			So we waited all day Tuesday for a call, but nothing happened.  So we called them.  Again we were told probably midnight as they were again very busy.
			<p />
			At 11:00pm yesterday night (Tuesday) we called the hospital again, only to be told they were too busy again!
			<p />
			Lisa was really upset by this, she had anticipated going in and felt let down again.
			<p />
			They told us they would phone in the next couple of hours when a bed became free.
			<p />
			We woke up this morning at 7am, still no call from the hospital, so I called them.  I was ready for a big argument too, about how emotional stress was driving Lisa mad (she hadn't slept in 3 days), but they just said come in now!
			<p />
			30 minutes later we were in the hospital and they started a drip to induce labour.
			<p />
			I won't go through all the messy details, but 11 hours later Abi arrived.
			<p />
			Lisa was fantastic, I am so proud of her. (I'm so glad I'm a man!!)
			<p />
			I went to fetch James and Lisa's mum (who had been looking after James all day) and James met his little sister for the first time.
			<p />
			The time is now 10:45pm PST and I'm exhausted, god only knows how Lisa feels.  Lisa and Abi are staying in the hospital and come home tomorrow.
			<p />
			I have to say I can't wait.
			<p />
			I took some pictures and have posted then here; I will take more tomorrow and maybe even make a short film.  So come back if you want to see more.
			<p />
			So in true female Seeley fashion Abi kept us all waiting :-)
