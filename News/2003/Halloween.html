			<h2>Halloween</h2>
			Friday 31st October 2003
			<p />
			Halloween here in the states is huge, when I say huge, I mean like Christmas in the UK.
			<p />
			As in the UK, the kids dress up and trick or treat.  Unlike the UK, offices open their doors to children, people decorate their houses (with loads of lights, loads of pumpkins and witches and ghosts etc.), and everyone celebrates the night.
			<p />
			It is not uncommon for adults to dress up too (in fact we saw quite a few).  Lisa saw a father and son walking through Redmond town centre, where the father was dressed as Superman and the son as Spiderman.
			<p />
			Adults also have parties, fancy dress ones of course.
			<p />
			One of our neighbours, James (who is also English and lived here in the States for 15 years), decorated his house with loads of orange fairy lights.  Lisa of course (those of you who know her will understand this), absolutely loved this.  She wanted me to do the same to our house.
			<p />
			I stupidly said I would do Christmas if she let Halloween go by, she jumped at the chance and today (1st December) came home with 9 boxes of house lights, each box containing 300 lights.  Guess what I'm doing this weekend!!!!
			<p />
			Anyway, back to Halloween.
			<p />
			We wanted to do something, so I decided to try and carve some cool pumpkins.
			<p />
			Having never tried to make anything very elaborate before, this was a major task.
			<p />
			We brought 4 pumpkins, one for each of us.  The idea being we would all carve a pumpkin, Abi was of course excused as she can't hold a knife properly yet.  We actually brought her one that was painted.
			<p />
			Anyway, I offered to help James with his.  As soon as he saw the mess inside a pumpkin he lost interest and walked off.  As a result I decided to "Go For It" and see what I could do.  Picture one is the result.
			<p />
			I was so impressed with my work, I carved my one (Picture two).
			<p />
			Now this sounds really sissy, but I actually bruised my wrists scooping out all the gunk, and as Lisa wasn't that interested, I left hers.
			<p />
			We put the pumpkins out on the night and got rave reviews from all the parents when they came round with the kids.  Some even took photos.
			<p />
			I think I can safely say I carved the best pumpkins in the street, something I pointed out to Lisa as we went trick or treating around all the houses.  In fact I pointed it out at every house we went to and she was pretty annoyed with me by the time we got home.
			<p />
			James went out dressed as a skeleton, and Abi was dressed as a pumpkin.  Sorry, but we completely forgot to take pictures.
			<p />
			James got loads of candy and gave loads out when the kids in the area called at our house.
			<p />
			He had earlier in the day spent an hour down town (Redmond) with Lisa trick or treating at the Redmond Doctors Plaza (the main buildings where all the doctors work in Redmond).  This was set up as a safe place for kids to visit in the afternoon.
			<p />
			I had left work early as Microsoft comes to a standstill in the afternoon, as loads of parents bring in their kids who visit all the workers for candy.
			<p />
			Later that night, Lisa and I went to a party, dressed as Dracula and a Witch (Lisa was the Witch :-)
			<p />
			We had arranged a babysitter, and had a great time at Dave Brankin's party.
			<p />
			It was actually a great day, trouble is, Lisa wants lights next year, oh well...
