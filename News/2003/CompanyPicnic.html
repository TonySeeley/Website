			<h2>Company Picnic</h2>
			Saturday 26th July 2003
			<p />
			Imagine the biggest picnic you have ever attended...
			<p />
			No think bigger...
			<p />
			Nope, you're nowhere near.
			<p />
			Last weekend Microsoft had their annual company picnic.  This "Picnic" is so large it has to be held over two days.  Approximately 50,000 people attend, 25,000 each day.
			<p />
			It is without doubt the best organized company event I have ever attended.
			<p />
			This is really Microsoft's annual family event, where they encourage employees to bring the kids and enjoy the day.
			<p />
			The event runs from 11am to 6pm on both days, we chose to go on Saturday and arrived around 1:30pm.  We were running a little late as James was invited to a friends birthday party.
			<p />
			My only task to remember was to get directions from work, and as usual I forgot.  I knew the picnic was taking place in North Bend, but I didn't know where in North Bend,  Fortunately, a work colleague was on line on Saturday morning so I asked her for directions using Windows Messenger.  I thought this was safe as I knew she was going and lived in North Bend too.
			<p />
			So, after picking up James we set off, the only problem was that the person who gave me directions was wrong!!  I won't embarrass her by giving her name (Julie Hagen) as she was very apologetic Monday morning.
			<p />
			Luckily, we spotted a Microsoft coach ferrying people to the picnic while driving through North Bend and we followed it to the event.
			<p />
			The setting for the picnic was amazing.  Basically, the picnic was being held in an enormous field (belonging to a local farm) with a backdrop of a massive mountain (I think it's called Mount Si).
			<p />
			There was just so much to do and we never really got to see everything.  We met up with David and Linda Dennis and their kids Jacob and Amaya, and spent the afternoon walking round the picnic.
			<p />
			There was a great big field that was being used as a sports race track, where parents and kids got to race in loads of silly races.  A stage where a Magic show was given.
			<p />
			They had a golf putting area and massive basket ball and soccer pitches that had massive balls, hoops and goals (I mean massive the balls must have been 4 foot in diameter).
			<p />
			There were loads and loads of bouncy castles for the kids, a train ride, pony and llama rides, a kids car wash (basically the kids ran though it getting soaked from above), and cages where you could fire water balloons at each other.
			<p />
			The food area was unbelievable, they had built a wooden wall that contained 20 hatches where food was given out.  You could go to one hatch and get corn, another and get a caesar salad, another to get hotdogs or burgers, another for ice creams and so it went on.
			<p />
			There was also two condiments stands where you could get salad and sauces for your food.
			<p />
			I tried my best to sample all the food, but failed miserably.
			<p />
			After lunch we walked round the bouncy castles and found loads of fairground type attractions for the kids to play on.
			<p />
			All around there were beer tents and water stands where you could get ice water or something stronger.  There was also areas where you could get your favourite canned drink.
			<p />
			Clowns and people dressed up as animals also walked around entertaining (or scaring) the kids.
			<p />
			They even had a bingo tent and a sound stage with a band performing.
			<p />
			It was amazing.
			<p />
			We stayed until just after 6pm and then joined the thousands leaving.
			<p />
			It was a great day.
			<p />
			Did I mention EVERYTHING was FREE.  It's great working for Microsoft :-)
