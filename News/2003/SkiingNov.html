			<h2>Skiing November</h2>
			Saturday 29th November 2003
			<p />
			Wow, just when you want it ... snow, loads of snow.
			<p />
			This weekend one of the Snoqualmie ski resorts opened up.  They had a load of snow leading up to the weekend and opened Summit West.
			<p />
			As a result we decided to go up to the slopes for the first time.
			<p />
			We had been having ski lessons at a place called Mini Mountain in Bellevue for about 6 weeks.  Mini Mountain instructors teach you to ski on a large moving carpet.  This doesn't simulate snow that well, but it does enable you to learn the necessary techniques you need on the snow.
			<p />
			I skied in the army, but that was 17 years ago, for Lisa and James however it was all new.  At Mini Mountain they were both doing really well.  James seemed to pick it up really quickly, and spent most lessons playing tag on the carpet with the instructor.
			<p />
			I don't think Lisa took to it as quickly as James, but she was definitely holding her own.
			<p />
			So, as the real slopes were now open we decided to go for it.
			<p />
			The day before we went to Mini Mountain to hire our skis and poles for the season.  We found out when we got there it usually takes a week to turn around the hire process, but they very kindly did it for us immediately.
			<p />
			So Saturday morning we set off.
			<p />
			We got to the Summit in 50 minutes from our front door, amazing to think we are that close to skiing.
			<p />
			Anyway, as it was the first weekend it wasn't very busy, which was great for Lisa and James.  No queue's anywhere.
			<p />
			Before we could ski we had to go and buy our ski passes for the season.  Lisa moaned the whole time as they had to take your picture for your pass and apparently she was having a bad hair day.  Luckily for her, she was allowed to leave her hat on.
			<p />
			We had agreed to meet Martin Perkins on the slopes, but poor Martin had to wait over an hour for us to get our passes and put Abi in child care.
			<p />
			Lisa wanted to inspect the child care facilities to make sure Abi would be OK.  I don't know what she was worried about, apparently they have never lost or killed a child to date and you always get the right one back when you go to collect (I asked).
			<p />
			Anyway, she couldn't put it off anymore, we finally got her out onto the slope.
			<p />
			Lisa and James putting on skis for the first time on snow was one of the funniest things I have ever seen.  They fell over a dozen times, it was hysterical.  Lisa's primary complaint was that it was very slippy.  I did point out that that was the point and it was the slippy nature of snow that made skiing possible.
			<p />
			They had a number of ski runs open, but Lisa and James were not ready for any of them yet.  They have a learner practice area on a gentle slope.  To take you up the slope is a conveyor belt you stand on called "The Magic Carpet".  Lisa and James spent 2 hours going up the Magic Carpet and skiing down the slope.
			<p />
			To start with they both forgot everything they had been taught and just put their skis together and shot down the slope.  Of course this culminated in a spectacular crash at the end.
			<p />
			I had never worked so hard in my life.  I kept having to take my skis off to help them up.
			<p />
			At Mini Mountain they basically teach you two techniques.  Pizza and Hotdog.  Pizza is the snow plough and hotdog is parallel skiing.  When you start skiing, the snow plough is taught to enable you to turn and stop.
			<p />
			So I'm at the top of this slope shouting Pizza, Pizza, Pizza to Lisa and James as they "Hotdog" down the slope at 20 miles an hour.
			<p />
			After about 40 minutes we encounter the James, "I don't want to do this anymore, it's rubbish" mantra.  This goes on for some time and is only stopped if he is successful, stops or is bribed.
			<p />
			Luckily, he got it.  He started to remember his Pizza and people stopped looking at me like I was a very hungry idiot.
			<p />
			About twenty minutes later, Lisa started to get it too.
			<p />
			James decided at this point that he loved skiing and wanted to do it all the time.
			<p />
			Once they seemed to be getting it, I skied down Little Thunder with Martin.
			<p />
			The pictures where taken after they stopped falling down.
