			<h2>Legoland Windsor</h2>
			Wednesday 20th August 2003
			<p />
			As a treat on James' birthday, we decided to spend the day in Legoland Windsor (for American readers, that's where the Queen lives :-) (Not in Legoland - Windsor Castle)
			<p />
			James loves Legoland, Lisa used to have season tickets and take James all the time.
			<p />
			Which is funny because the first time Lisa went, she wrote a letter of complaint to the Legoland company (she used to be very big on complaint letters).  She even stated (if memory serves me), that she could still smell the old Rhinoceros enclosure from Windsor Safari Park (Legoland was built on the site of Windsor Safari Park).
			<p />
			The people at Legoland wrote a very polite letter back apologizing for the smell (What smell???) and enclosed tickets to go again, hoping Lisa would give them a second chance.  We must have been back a hundred times since then. :-)
			<p />
			Anyway, (back to James' birthday) we went with Lisa's sister Nikki and her two boys Jordan (8) and Regan (6) - James' best mates, and had a blast.
			<p />
			We spent all day walking around seeing the sights.  Stopping every now and again for the boys to try the rides.
			<p />
			I particularly liked the model world exhibit, where they basically create models of most of the cities in the world.  It's very cool and must have taken hours to build.
			<p />
			We went down to the lake and saw the "Jack Stone" show, which the boys really liked.
			<p />
			The boys also got the chance to pass their Legoand driving test (Lisa should have done this :-), which involved them having to sit through a boring presentation (Regan's comments) on the rules of the road (including road signs) and having their pictures taken for their licenses.  They were then set loose on the open road (well actually it was a pretend road just for the kids) where they navigated themselves round traffic lights, stop signs, roundabouts and pedestrian crossings.  How they passed and got their licenses I will never know!
			<p />
			Towards the end of the day, we spent some time building cars in Lego that raced down hills.  Apparently I got all competitive and took everything too seriously - I mean does that sound like me? (Anyway my car was best and won all the races).
			<p />
			We left the Lego Racers ride till the end as it was at the top of the hill and the boys favorite.  Unfortunately, when we got there it was closed - this was the day's only disappointment.
			<p />
			We didn't want to buy loads of presents in England and have to bring them home to the US, so we agreed to get some nice small prezzies in Legoland and get James loads when we got back.  James was OK with this as he realized he was going to get loads.
			<p />
			So we went into the Legoland shop and brought a few small toys.  OK, we got some medium sized toys. OK, OK we brought the shop.
			<p />
			James of course had a great day.
