			<h2>Karen & David Visit</h2>
			Sunday 21st - Sunday 28th September 2003
			<p />
			This week we had visitors from the UK.  Karen and David came over to stay with us while David attended a course at Microsoft.
			<p />
			Karen spent the week with Lisa while David and I worked.
			<p />
			Lisa showed Karen all the shops and Karen spent loads :-).  Including $200 in Bath and Bodyworks.
			<p />
			Karen fell in love with Bellevue Mall and Bath and Bodyworks.
			<p />
			When ever Dave and I got in from work, Karen would proceed to tease David with what she'd seen.
			<p />
			Thursday night we had arranged a babysitter for James and Abi so we could all go out for dinner and we picked the perfect place.  We had booked a table at the Metropolitan Grill in downtown Seattle.  This is probably one of Seattle's posher restaurants.  The Met basically serves steak, but it's just about the best steak you've ever had.
			<p />
			We went Thursday night and enjoyed an amazing meal.
			<p />
			After dinner we did a little tour of downtown, familiarizing Dave and Karen with parts of Seattle.
			<p />
			Fortunately David's course finished Thursday so he had Friday off to explore Seattle.  I also took the day off to show them around.
			<p />
			All week the weather had been fantastic, and it looked like it was going to continue over the weekend.
			<p />
			Friday started in downtown carrying on from the night before, only this time James and Abi joined us.  This all worked really well as James was off school on a holiday anyway.
			<p />
			We visited Pike Place Market, and then went over to the Space Needle.
			<p />
			Neither Dave or Karen like heights much, so I was very sympathetic :-) (I only told them the needle swayed a little in the wind, oh yeah and we were due a big earthquake).
			<p />
			Anyway, we finally got them up the Needle and I think they were pleased they went.  The views were fantastic, including an amazing view of Mount Rainer.
			<p />
			After the Space Needle we popped into an amusement arcade where James went of a frog hopper and Karen showed her strength with an arm wrestling machine (I was much nicer to her after that - she is strong :-)
			<p />
			Next we decided to go on a Seattle tour (a proper one this time) - so we brought tickets for the Duck Tours.  This was really funny as we were given Duck Callers.  As we went along the road everyone would blow their Duck Callers and get waves from passers by... sounds stupid I know but it was fun.
			<p />
			The driver gave a good tour as well and even drove the amphibious vehicle into Lake Union and we went past the house boat from Sleepless in Seattle.
			<p />
			After the tour we were all feeling hungry so we went to the CheeseCake Factory. The problem was we had tickets to a Mariners baseball game and didn't have time for Cheese Cake :-)  (I was of course very upset by this being the only person on a diet).  However, someone had the great idea to take cake home with us. (damn)
			<p />
			So off we went to the game.  This was a big game with the Oakland Athletics and we smashed them :-) :-) GO MARINERS
			<p />
			We have been to quite a few games this year and have even brought season tickets for next year.  I love it, James loves it, even Lisa has started to learn the players :-)
			<p />
			The game finished quite late for the kids so after the game we headed for home.
			<p />
			Saturday morning we wanted to go to South Center Mall.  We wanted to go as there is a very good music shop down there and David is learning the drums.
			<p />
			We went into a couple of shops and had some lunch.  On the way back we decided to pop into the Family Fun Center to hit some balls in a baseball cage. We all felt inspired after the night before's game.
			<p />
			The cages throw either Softballs (much slower and a higher curve) or baseballs (much faster and straight at you).
			<p />
			We all had a go, even James although he stopped when a ball hit his hand.
			<p />
			Lisa hit some balls and so did Karen.
			<p />
			Dave and I were feeling a little cocky so we went for the fast baseballs.  We moved up to a faster cage that fired 60 mile an hour balls at you.  It was terrifying - very fast and incredibly hard to get a good hit.  We hit a few (very few well) and left with some nasty blisters (so that's why they wear gloves :-) (I should point out here professional pitchers throw balls between 80 and 100 mph.)
			<p />
			On the way home we went for dinner and called it a night.
			<p />
			Sunday was Karen and Dave's last day so we decided to go down to Snoqualmie Falls.  So we took them down there, unfortunately the falls were not that impressive as the water level in the mountains is low at this time of year, but they both said they liked it.
			<p />
			To finish the day before taking them to the airport we took them to Tweede's in North Bend.  Tweede's is the diner where they filmed Twin Peaks.  In fact it's the place where Agent Cooper had his amazing Cherry Pie and damn fine cup of coffee, so that's what everyone had (except me, I was on salad).
			<p />
			After that we left for home to collect their cases.
			<p />
			In all we packed alot into those 2.5 days.  We got them both to the airport in time for their flight and said goodbye.
			<p />
			Hopefully they enjoyed themselves enough to want to come back.  We certainly enjoyed their company and had a great week.
