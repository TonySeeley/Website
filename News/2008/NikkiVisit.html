			<h2>Nikki Jordan & Regan Visit</h2>
			Monday 11th August - Monday 1st September 2007
			<p />

			Every year without fail Nikki, Jordan and Regan come over from the UK to visit us.  We LOVE their visits and miss them terribly through the year but even if it's once a year, it's so nice seeing how the boys have grown.
			<p />
			Sure enough, earlier in the year Nikki booked their visit, and this time arranged to come over for three weeks.  On top of that Nikki asked if Lisa and I would like to have a weekend away to Vegas while she looked after James and Abi.  We, of course, said yes and had a blast in Vegas while James and Abi had fun with Jordan and Regan.
			<p />
			As Nikki, Jordan and Regan have been here so many times, we don't have to do the touristly thing (they have virtually done it all), we just all hang out together and have fun.
			<p />
			They each have their favorite things to do, Nikki likes the shopping, Jordan now likes the shopping too (so he can get something cool to wear at home that nobody else can get) and Regan is a man after my own heart, who likes the restaurants.
			<p />
			This year we had a wonderful three weeks.  We all went on a Lake Washington boat trip, Lisa took them to Leavenworth (our local Bavarian town :-) and for Regan we ate at all his favorite places.
			<p />
			Everything was great until their last day when Regan fell and hit his head and had a nasty cut.  Nikki and I took him to the ER where they superglued his head together and charged Nikki $1000.  Luckily, no major damage done.
			<p />
			It was another great visit and we miss them already, the boys are both growing into really nice young men and Nikki I have to say was looking really hot (shouldn't say that about a sister-in-law I know but it's true :-)
			<p />
			Till next year guys...
