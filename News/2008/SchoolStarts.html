			<h2>Back to School</h2>
			Tuesday 2nd September 2008
			<p />
			After a very long summer the time came for James and Abi to go back to school.
			<p />
			James wasn't happy about this obviously.  He knew he was now going into 6th grade and homework was coming back.  On top of that he would have to get up before 9:30am - and for a boy who stays awake until after 11pm (just to annoy me) this wasn't good.
			<p />
			Abi however saw things differently.  To say she was excited is a huge understatement.  She has been talking about going to school since June - driving us all mad.  You see last year she was still in pre-school only attending 3 mornings a week.  This year she entered full time kindergarden and also (for the one and only time in her life) was in the same school as her brother.
			<p />
			James is like me really.  I was never a fan of school (who was?) and have numerous school reports where the teacher would say, "What a pity he doesn't apply himself..." you know the kind of thing.
			<p />
			Abi is cut from a different cloth.  She asks us to give her homework, she is reading 2nd grade books now and clearly enjoys learning.  I'm not saying she is smarter than James, it's just that she loves to learn, he doesn't.
			<p />
			Anyway, the day finally arrived for that first day of school.  James was (as expected) super depressed, but Abi was out of control excited.  The previous night she couldn't sleep and in the morning was grinning like a loon.
			<p />
			She changed her clothes numerous times trying to find that "perfect" outfit and agreed to pose for some pictures.
			<p />
			After a breakfast that nobody ate (James because he was too depressed and Abi because she was too nervous/excited), we left for school.
			<p />
			The elementary school in our neighborhood is a walking school - no yellow school bus - and as it was a lovely day we decided to walk and had agreed to meet some neighbors in the street so we could all go together.
			<p />
			Abi had on her new backpack and walked with her friend Valerie, who was also entering kindergarden.
			<p />
			We reached school and stood in line in the playground waiting to be called to class.  Abi was especially pleased as she was head of the line, being the first in her class to show up.
			<p />
			Abi's teacher Mrs. Brown came out, posed for a picture and hugged all the kids (I don't remember that when I started school!)
			<p />
			Then it was waves and smiles as they filed into class.
			<p />
			I popped over to see James but he was busy talking to his friends and I didn't want to embarrass him with a photograph.
			<p />
			That night when I got home, James was feeling a little better and Abi was super excited about her first day of school and gave me a run down of everything that happened through her day.
			<p />
			Moving forward a couple of weeks, routine is setting in.  For James he has accepted his lot and is just getting on with school.  Abi is complaining however that she can't go to school on weekends (I know odd!) but by Friday is exhausted and quite frankly horrible to live with.
			<p />
			I told her she couldn't go to school on Saturday and Sunday as her head would explode with new knowledge, but the real reason is she would become even harder to live with without those two days to rest, and Lisa and I would probably kill her.
			<p />
			Let's see if she still loves school when she's 11.
