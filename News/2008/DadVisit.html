			<h2>Dad & Chris Visit Seattle</h2>
			Tuesday 15th - Monday 21st April 2008
			<p />

			One of the disadvantages of living in the States is that the kids are so far away from their grandparents.
			<p />
			This is especially hard for my parents for the following reasons.  My father does not have the best health these days and a ten-hour plane flight is particularly harsh.  On top of that, travel insurance to come to the States is a necessity and pretty expensive when you get older.  For Lisa's parents it's a little easier, they are both younger and have better health.  Also as Roger, Lisa's dad, worked for British Airways for 30 years, they benefit from heavily subsidized flights, so the costs are more manageable.
			<p />
			So I hear you ask, why don't you go to the UK?  There are a number of reasons why this isn't great either.  Firstly flights are pretty expensive right now and I have to buy four tickets.  Then when we get there we suffer terribly with the exchange rate (as the American dollar is currently in the toilet).  On top of that I need a car, somewhere to stay (family offer of course but I always feel guilty when my lot descend and tear the house apart).  Then finally there is the fun factor for the kids.  Or should I say the lack of fun.  When we do visit the UK, all we do is visit people's houses and drink tea.  I love it but for James and Abi, it's not much of a vacation.
			<p />
			So this year it was a lovely surprise when my Dad felt well enough to come and visit.
			<p />
			His plan was to fly into Seattle, spend a week with us and then travel up to Vancouver to see old friends for a week and then fly home.
			<p />
			So the day finally came for their visit.  We wanted to make their stay special so we rented a limousine to collect them from the airport.  The kids made a banner to welcome them here and we set off to get them.
			<p />
			Lisa and I were a little nervous as James and Abi hadn't seen my Dad and Chris for some time and we were worried they might be a little shy - the major concern being it could take them a week to get used to them and then they would leave!  But we really needn't of worried.  Abi had been asking lots of questions before they arrived and we kept telling her how naughty I was as a little boy and that she should ask Grandad Gerry to tell her all about me.
			<p />
			At first James and Abi were a little quiet, but it lasted like 5 hours!  Then unfortunately for Dad, Abi was stuck to him like a limpet for the whole week!  Every time I looked over at him, Abi was sat on his lap with her face 5 inches from his asking questions.
			<p />
			I took the week off so we could explore the area together.
			<p />
			We visited all the usual touristy attractions, the Space Needle, Pike Place Market and Snoqualmie Falls.  We did lots of shopping too, with Lisa trying to help Chris spend her money and Dad trying to stop her.
			<p />
			One thing we did that was a first for us, was that we visited the tulip fields up in Skagit County, which is about 2 hours north from us.  It was so bizarre we literally experienced every kind of weather on the way, we had sun, snow and heavy rain - very odd.
			<p />
			The tulips were beautiful though and we had a lovely day out and took some great pictures of all the family.
			<p />
			The funny thing is I probably spent more dedicated time with my dad this week than I had in the last 20 years, and I had to travel 5 thousand miles away to do it - life's very strange.
			<p />
			On their last night Dad took us out for a lovely dinner at Daniels and the following day I drove Dad and Chris up to Bremerton to meet his Canadian friend, Tom Torrance.
			<p />
			We had a wonderful time when they were here and the kids are still talking about them.  I guess it's time to re-visit the UK, so next year we plan to go back for our vacation - I'd better start saving now!
