Officially her role is Co-VP Ways and Means.			<p />			Anyway, on the 19th September she organized a big fundraiser at the school. She organized food and drink for parents and students who attended and hired the "Reptile Man" to come and put on a show for the kids.			<p />			The ask was for parents to put their hand in their pocket and donate money. She was asking for $95 per family. This money goes towards classroom supplies, field trips and after school activities etc., so the kids really benefit.			<p />			The irony is, that any adults who work for Microsoft (and a few other companies in the area too) can ask for "Matching Funds". This means Microsoft will donate what ever you donate to a registered charity up to a maximum of $10,000 a year.			<p />			Actually as a side note, Microsoft goes one step further and will let it's employees take paid time off work to help schools and other registered charities and will then donate $17 for every hour the employee works - pretty good really.			<p />			So a Microsoft parent would only have to donate about $50 per child for the whole year, which in reality is nothing!			<p />			She had an amazing turn out, over 500 people (including kids) attended. But they only raised $4,000, which was a real shame. (They wanted to raise $6,000). The hope is everyone applies for matching funds and they end up with $8,000 - time will tell.			<p />			The bottom line is she worked really hard and I'm very proud of her - she did fantastic.			<p />			To help her remember the event :-), the reptile man let Lisa hold 'Lucy' his baby crocodile. Someone took some pictures and I liked them so decided to share them with you.			<p />			Incidentally, Lisa has also now been accepted as a Substitute Instructional Assistant (IA) in the school and get this, they pay her for it. Basically she has to do safety patrol in the morning when the kids are coming in, help teachers in the classrooms, help in the office and watch the kids don't kill each other at recess (playtime) - did I mention she gets paid?			<p />			So Lisa has a job - Yippy.			<p />			Oh did I mention she has to volunteer to do work (which she hasn't done yet :-()		</div>	</div>	<div class="footer">		<p id="footer">&nbsp;</p>		<script type="text/javascript">			document.getElementById("m_news").style.color = "#0b67d4";			document.getElementById("m_news2008").style.background = "#e37e00";			updatePage("m_news");		</script>	</div>	<!--#include virtual="./../imageTable.html"--></body></html>
