			<h2>Abi in a Korean Dress</h2>
			Saturday 12th April 2008
			<p />
			Some of you know that I now work in the Microsoft Mobile Communications Business, specifically on Windows Mobile.
			<p />
			Anyway, I won't bore everyone with the details, but we have customers all round the world. Phone manufacturers are everywhere, but a number of popular phones are made in the Far East.
			<p />
			In April I was given the opportunity to visit Taiwan and South Korea to present to HTC and Samsung.
			<p />
			As I had never been to that part of the world before it was a really great experience.
			<p />
			I had the opportunity to eat in some amazing restaurants and see some wonderful sights.  One great experience was going up Taipei 101, which is an amazing one and a half thousand foot high skyscraper in Taipei.  It's kind of bamboo shaped (hard to explain) but very cool.
			<p />
			Anyway, I decided to look for some nice dresses for Abi.  This was much harder than you would think as most of the shops sold modern Western clothes.  They even have a Marks and Spencers! (Reference to an English shop for US readers).
			<p />
			I looked everywhere in Taipei without any luck.  So when we moved on to Seoul in South Korea I tried again.
			<p />
			This was much better as we were taken to a flea market in the city center.  Here they had everything (almost too much choice).  However I eventually found a traditional Korean dress (as modeled by Abi in the pictures above).
			<p />
			They had loads of colors but obviously I looked for pink and purple.
			<p />
			She loved the dress, promised to wear it all the time, and of course has never worn it since.  Oh well it only cost $100 - sob sob...
