			<h2>Las Vegas Visit</h2>
			Sunday 24th - Wednesday 27th August 2008
			<p />
			For some time now Lisa has wanted to go to Las Vegas.  We nearly made it a few years ago.  We had the flights booked, the hotel reservation ready and tickets to see Elton John, we even had Lisa's mum, Janet, coming over to look after the kids so we could go and have fun.  Then I got an infection in my leg and ended up in hospital.
			<p />
			Lisa was obviously very disappointed but we said we would go one day.
			<p />
			So fast forward to earlier this year and Lisa was having a telephone conversation with Nikki in the UK.  Nikki was planning to come and visit in August and offered to look after James and Abi so we could get away for a long weekend.  We of course said YES and started planning the trip.
			<p />
			So eventually the time came. Nikki, Jordan and Regan came out to visit and Lisa and I went off to Vegas.
			<p />
			The plan was simple, leave on Sunday, come back on Wednesday and have fun! Nothing too fancy, take in a show or two, eat in nice restaurants and relax, kid free.
			<p />
			We had asked around for recommendations and decided to stay at Caesars Palace.  It was pretty much in the middle of the strip and we had been told it was a great place to stay.
			<p />
			So Caesars it was.  We arrived early afternoon on Sunday and started to plan our 3 days.  We wanted to eat at MESA grill (Bobby Flay's restaurant) we had already booked tickets to go and see Love and we also wanted to enjoy the spa for an afternoon and, of course, Lisa wanted to shop.
			<p />
			Lisa also had the idea to go and renew our wedding vows with Elvis, especially as we would be celebrating our 20th anniversary this year.
			<p />
			So what did we get up to?
			<p />
			Well, we had the afternoon in the spa, with an amazing massage and spent time in the hot tubs, snow room and sauna.  We went to see Love (which was absolutely FANTASTIC).  We ate at the MESA grill (also very good) and did the whole shopping thing and spent FAR too much money.  We also went to see Nathan Burton who was a comic magician.
			<p />
			But by far the funniest experience was visiting the Graceland Wedding Chapel and having our vows renewed by Elvis.  Elvis was fantastic, didn't leave character once and we laughed the whole way through.  And here is the best part, it was all videoed and you can watch it here.

			The ironic part of the whole trip was we only gambled $80 and that was because we thought we ought to.  We couldn't lose the money fast enough so we could go and do something fun elsewhere!  I guess we just aren't into the tables :-( - but we really didn't care we had fun anyway :-).
			<p />
			While we were there the temperature was 105 degrees but that was fine, we had a blast and will go back again in another 20 years to renew our vows again.
			<p />
			Nikki, thank you SO much, we really appreciated the time away.
