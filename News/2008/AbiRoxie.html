			<h2>Abi & Roxie</h2>
			Friday 5th September 2008
			<p />
			I know what you're thinking.  You have another dog - why?
			<p />
			I appreciate our track record is not great, but we are hopeful this time we will be more successful.
			<p />
			So lets recap what happened last time.  We all wanted a dog and I have always liked Terriers, so we got a Cairn, McKala.  She was a lovely dog, great with the kids and loved the family.  However she also loved the furniture, as apparently it tasted fantastic.
			<p />
			After a year of McKala eating the furniture she finally stopped - wow, we thought she is out of the eating the couch stage.  So we brought a new couch.  Well it seemed we were wrong, she was just bored with the old couch, but the new one tasted even better.
			<p />
			I loved McKala, but I also loved the $4,000 I had just spent on new furniture, so McKala went back to the breeder.
			<p />
			NO MORE DOGS.  That's what we all said (well that's what Lisa said anyway).
			<p />
			So about 6 months later, a pet shop opened in our local shops.  No big problem there.  But, and it's a very big but, they sold puppies.  What's worse is that they encouraged people to go in and play with the puppies.  How dare they!
			<p />
			So Lisa took Abi in there so Abi could play with a puppy.  The idea being, Abi would get her "puppy fix" there and we would never need to buy another dog.  Great plan eh?
			<p />
			The only problem was it wasn't Abi who needed the puppy fix.  It started out with, we are never getting another dog, we are just playing with them in the shop.  I should have suspected things were amiss when I found out Lisa was forcing Abi to visit the pet shop 4 times a week.
			<p />
			Soon it became, "we got the wrong breed, if I ever got a dog again it wouldn't be a Terrier - but I'm still not getting a dog..." and Lisa and Abi kept going back.
			<p />
			Then one day I get an email at work from Lisa with a picture of the James holding a very cute little puppy.  Then an email follows letting me know puppies are $200 off this weekend.
			<p />
			So I email Lisa back telling her to cut the crap.  If she wants a dog she can get one but she can't blame me if things go bad.  I know what Lisa wanted, she wanted ME to say lets get a dog.  Then she would say no, I would argue, she would cave in, and the blame me forever when the dog ate the house.
			<p />
			I made it really clear she had to decide, it would be HER dog.  Besides we were about to go on vacation for two weeks and we couldn't kennel a puppy as the have to be 6 months old.
			<p />
			Phew - danger averted - or so I thought.
			<p />
			So two weeks later I get a call at work and Lisa tells me she has found the perfect dog.  She is a Maltese Shih-tzu mix, her name is Roxie (Lisa and Abi had named her already) and she loved the kids.
			<p />
			I pointed out we were going on vacation in two days, but Lisa explained that it was OK, the shop had very kindly offered to look after Roxie when we were away.  Oh goody.
			<p />
			So I explained I didn't think she should buy a puppy without me seeing it first, but she had figured that out too.  She was on her way over in the car (with Roxie) so I could "meet her".
			<p />
			So they came over, Roxie was as advertised, beautiful.
			<p />
			So that night when I got home I had a new dog.
			<p />
			I must admit, she is adorable and very different to McKala.  She doesn't chew furniture at all - just my computer cables :-(
			<p />
			Anyway, I thought I ought to post some pictures, so here is Roxie with Abi.
