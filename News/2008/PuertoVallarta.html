			<h2>Puerto Vallarta Vacation</h2>
			Monday 21st July - Monday 4th August 2008
			<p />

			Two years ago we had an amazing vacation in Mexico.  Last year the kids experienced Disney World in Florida (for Abi the first time), so this year we wanted to give the kids another memorable holiday.
			<p />
			Lisa as always did her investigation and came up with Puerto Vallarta, again in Mexico. Only this time on the Pacific coastline.
			<p />
			We booked our two-week holiday for the end of July until the beginning of August and eventually the time came for us head South to the sun.
			<p />
			The start of the vacation was not that auspicious as we nearly missed our flight!  Lisa had booked a car service to come and pick us up at 4am to drive us to the airport.  We all got up on time, had our bags packed and excitedly sat and waited for the car to arrive.  After 20 minutes we started to worry, so called the service.  We were told the driver would call us back and sure enough 5 minutes later he called and asked if we still needed the service as he was running late!  He had clearly just woken up.  As we had no other way of getting to the airport, we told him to get his arse in gear (nice British term for "hurry up") and come and pick us up.
			<p />
			The driver promised to be here in 15 minutes, and successfully arrived half an hour later.  He then drove like a loony doing over 90 miles an hour to the airport.  It was one of those weird dichotomies where part of me wanted to say "slow down" and part wanted to me to say "go faster".  It didn't help that he kept using his cell phone (which is now illegal in Washington State) - Oh well.  Anyway we arrived safely - no idea how and made the flight.
			<p />
			Luckily the flight was a non-event, the kids behaved well and we arrived in Puerto Vallarta with no other issues.
			<p />
			Now I should point out a couple of things here.  Last time we were in Mexico we went to Cancun, to the most amazing hotel I have ever seen.  It had like seven swimming pools, a lazy river and a big wave machine.  A swim up bar and ... well everything - you get the picture.  We naturally thought all Mexico hotels were like this.
			<p />
			However in conversation Lisa found out that Enas and Simon, who live down the road, visited the same hotel earlier in the year, so we met to discuss it and it was very apparent we were about to be disappointed :-(
			<p />
			When we finally got to the hotel, it was as we expected.  Much smaller, nowhere near as nice as Cancun, but we decided to make the most of it and put on a happy face.
			<p />
			If truth be told the hotel was not really that bad, we were just so spoilt with Cancun we had rather unrealistic expectations.
			<p />
			The hotel had four pools, one was for adults only (that was the one with a swim up bar - obviously), one was kind of out of the way so we never used it, the main pool was not that big and was full to the brim with hotel guests and the last pool was two feet deep with a couple of water slides and a massive pirate ship for the kids to play in.
			<p />
			At the end of the day James and Abi thought it was fantastic and that's really what mattered.
			<p />
			The hotel was all inclusive, so we were given the obligatory wristbands so we could all get drinks and food whenever we wanted.
			<p />
			The hotel had a large buffet restaurant and four themed restaurants where you had to make a reservation and follow a dress code!  Also one of the "posh" restaurants wouldn't allow kids under eight years old, so we crossed that one off our list.  We tried two of the others and they were totally average so we lived in the family buffet restaurant.
			<p />
			Another delightful discovery was that August in Mexico on the Pacific Coast is the tropical storm season.  The day would start out really hot and sunny, but by 5pm the clouds would roll in and we would have amazing thunderstorms and torrential rain, which actually was pretty cool as it cleared the air and was fun to watch.  The funny part was that the road outside the hotel clearly couldn't cope with the amount of water and would flood every evening.  Then the following morning someone would come out with a water pump and suck up all the water.
			<p />
			The location of the hotel was north of the town center right next to the marina.  Twice a week a huge cruise ship would come in, stay for a couple of days then sail out to sea (usually in a thunderstorm).  There was also a Pirate "party ship" that went out twice a day and laid on fireworks just off the beach in the evening.  James wanted to go on the Pirate Ship but it "seemed" to be all about drinking tequila and looked like it was targeted towards late teens and early twenties.
			<p />
			So what did we do and was it really all that bad?
			<p />
			The bottom line is lots, and no it was great :-)
			<p />
			We went out in dune buggies for the afternoon - which was hysterical as I went with James, and Lisa and Abi went with the guide and James complained the whole time as I kept driving through puddles and he was getting dirty :-) - I loved it.
			<p />
			James and I went out on a jet ski until James cried and I had to bring him back in.  This was after my hat blew off and I dived in to get it forgetting I had $200 sunglasses on at the time.  Never saw those again, but on a positive note I got my $10 hat back.
			<p />
			We went to downtown Puerto Vallarta in the middle of the day and the kids complained the whole time as we made them walk too much and they hated shopping etc., you get the picture.  Lisa and I liked it though.
			<p />
			And we went out on a snorkel/boat trip to a village called Yelapa, where we got to snorkel in the sea (well I did with Abi until she started to cry while James and Lisa watched us from the boat), and hike inland to a waterfall that we could swim in, until James got out because it was too cold, and then hike across the village, the jungle and wade across an estuary to a stony beach that hurt your feet, for some over priced beer, while Lisa complained about the length of the walk and lack of cool shops! - But I enjoyed it.
			<p />
			So what I hear you ask, did the kids enjoy?
			<p />
			Well basically the beach and the pools.  James and Abi loved playing in the sand and spent hours building boats and castles, and practically grew gills as they spent so much time in the water (that would be the pool obviously as neither would go in the sea).
			<p />
			We also met a lovely family there who ironically lived about twenty miles from Redmond who had two children that James and Abi loved playing with (hi to Mike, Heidi, Sam and Mitchell).
			<p />
			So was the vacation a success?
			<p />
			Definitely, I had no work and got some quality time playing with James and Abi.  We swam loads and laughed a lot and made some new friends.
			<p />
			Mind you I don't think we will be going Puerto Vallarta again :-)
