			<h2>Cockney Rhyming Slang</h2>
			I appreciate this is an unusual thing to add to our web site, but Lisa and I still use British colloquialisms, specifically those from London, and are frequently asked "What does that mean?". As a result I thought I would compile a list of popular British'izums.
			<p />
			This proved to be an interesting (and fun) task, as it brought back many memories of phrases and terms we used to use all the time. I originally created this as a word document to give to some friends and it was suggested I add it to the site. So here it is :-) <p>
			<font color="red"><b>Parental Warning</b></font> - This part of the site not for kids.  I have included ALL slang terms I could find or know and many are for adult eyes only.
			<p />
			Before going any further it’s probably worth giving some explanations.
			<p />
			A true Cockney is someone born within the sound of Bow Bells. (St Mary-le-Bow Church in Cheapside, London).
			<p />
			However the term Cockney is now loosely applied to many born outside this area as long as they have a "Cockney" accent or a Cockney heritage (or even just come from London).
			<p />
			Rhyming Slang phrases are derived from taking an expression which rhymes with a word and then using that expression instead of the word. For example the word "look" rhymes with "butcher's hook". In many cases the rhyming word is omitted - so you won't find too many Londoners having a "bucher's hook", but you might find a few having a "butcher's".
			<p />
			The rhyming word is not always omitted so Cockney expressions can vary in their construction, and it is simply a matter of convention which version is used.
			<p />
			Cockney Rhyming Slang originated in the East End of London, I was always told by the "criminal fraternity" who wanted to talk in a pub without the police over hearing. I have no idea if this is true, but it's a great story. Some slang expressions have escaped from London and are in popular use throughout the rest of Britain. For example "use your loaf" is an everyday phrase for the British, but not too many people realise it is Cockney Rhyming Slang ("loaf of bread: head"). There are many more examples of this unwitting use of Cockney Rhyming Slang.
			<p />
			Enjoy...
