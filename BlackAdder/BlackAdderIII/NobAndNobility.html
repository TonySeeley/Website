			<b>SCENE ONE: MRS MIGGINS'S COFFEE SHOP</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>There is something different about the decoration - it is all tricolour - red, white and blue
			with strings of garlic hanging everywhere.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good day, Mrs Miggins.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Bonjewer, rnonsewer.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Bonjewer, monsewer. It's French.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So is eating frogs, cruelty to geese and urinating in the street. But that's no reason to inflict
			it on the rest of us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			But French is all the fashion. My coffee shop is full of Frenchies - and all because of that
			wonderful Scarlet Pimpernel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The Scarlet Pimpernel is not wonderful, Mrs Miggins. There is no reason whatsoever to admire
			someone for filling London with a load of garlic-chewing French toffs crying 'ooh-la-la' and
			looking for sympathy all the time just because their fathers had their heads cut off. I'll have
			a cup of coffee, and some shepherd's pie, please.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oh! We don't serve pies any more. My French clientele consider pie uncouth.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I hardly think a nation that eats frogs and would go to bed with the kitchen sink if it put on a
			tutu is in any position to preach couthness. So, what is on the menu?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Today's hot choice is: Chicken Pimpernel in a Scarlet Sauce, Scarlet Chicken in a Pimpernel Sauce
			or Huge Suspicious-looking Sausages in Scarlet Pimpernel Sauce.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What exactly is Scarlet Pimpernel Sauce?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			You take a large ripe frog - squeeze it ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. All right. Thank you. I'm off to the pub.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns to go. A Frenchman passes him and bows elaborately.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Frenchman</b><br />
			Ah, bonjour, monsieur.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sod off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is in the kitchen. Blackadder storms in, picks up the cat and drop-kicks</i>
			<i>it.</i><br />
			 <br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Sir! Poor little Mildred the cat, what's he ever done to you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It is the way of the world, Baldrick - the abused always kick downwards. I am annoyed and so I
			kick the cat, the cat ... (<i>There is a squeak</i>) pounces on the mouse and, finally,
			(<i>Baldrick squeals in pain</i>) the mouse bites you on the behind.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			And what do I do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Nothing, you are last in God's great chain. Unless there's an earwig around here you'd like to
			victimize. My God, Baldrick - what's happened to your nose?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is sporting the most hideous purple blister.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Nice, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, Baldrick. It isn't. It's revolting.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'll take it off then.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Rather unexpectedly, Baldrick simply peels off the blister.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, why are you wearing a false boil? What are we to expect next? A beauty wart? A
			cosmetic verucca?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It's a Scarlet Pimple, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			They're all the rage down our way. Everyone wants to express their admiration for the great Pimple
			and his brilliant disguises.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What has this fellow done apart from pop over to France to grab a few French nobs from the
			ineffectual clutches of a bunch of malnourished wingeing lefties, taking the opportunity while
			there - no doubt - to pick up some really good cheap wine and some of their marvellous open fruit
			flans. Doesn't anyone know? We hate the French! We fight wars against them! Did all those men die
			in vain on the field of Agincourt? Was the man who burnt Joan of Arc simply wasting good matches?<br />
			<br />
			<i>A bell rings.</i><br />
			<br />
			Ah! His Royal Highness the Pinhead of Wales summons. And, you know, I feel almost well disposed
			towards him: utter chump though he may be, at least he's not French.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George is with two pals ... Lord Smedley and Lord Topper, utter prats. They are sitting
			on the bed, very refined in ruffled shirts.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Une toast, I say, encore une toast. Le Pimpernel Scarlet!<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Le Pimpernel Scarlet!<br />
			<br />
			<i>A knock on the door. Blackadder enters and stands in the doorway.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah, Le Adder Noir, come in. (<i>To pals</i>) This is the fellow to ask, you chaps, my butler -
			terribly clever, brighter than a brain pie. Blackadder, we're trying to guess who the Pimpernel
			is so we can send him an enormous postal order to express our admiration. Any ideas?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm sure if you address the envelope to the Biggest Show-off in London, it would reach him
			eventually.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			Tish an pish, gadzooks, milarky. How dare you say such a thing! Demme sir, if you're not the
			worst kind of swine!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			Dem that swine!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm sorry, sir. I was merely pointing out that sneaking aristocrats out from under the noses of
			French revolutionaries is about as difficult as putting on a hat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			Sink me, sir, this is treason! The Scarlet Pimpernel is a hero! The Revolution is orchestrated
			by a ruthless band of highly organized killers, dem them!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			Dem those organized killers!!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			George, if I remember rightly, we were just discussing the French Embassy Ball in honour of the
			exiled aristocracy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			We certainly were. Where I intend to wear the most magnificent pair of trousers ever to issue
			forth from the delicate hands of Messrs Snibcock and Turkey, Couturiers to the Very Wealthy and the Extremely Fat. If the Pimpernel does finally reveal himself, I don't want to get caught in boring trousers.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			Dem those boring trousers.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			Well, what say we all bet your cocksure domestic 1,000 guineas that he can't go to France, rescue
			an aristocrat and present him at the ball. (<i>To Blackadder</i>) Ha!
			That's turned you white, hasn't it? That's frightened you, you lily-livered, caramel kidneyed,
			custard-coloured cad. Not so buoyant now, are ye? Eh? Eh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			Eh?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Little pause. Blackadder is cucumber cool.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			On the contrary, sirs. I'll just go pack. Perhaps Lord Smedley and Lord Topper will accompany me?
			I'm sure it will he a fairly easy trip. The odd death-defying leap, and modest amount of dental
			torture. Want to come?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			Oh, no.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			Oh, no.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			Dem.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			Dem.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They scrabble for excuses.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			Any day now - I've got an appointment with my doctor - I've got a sniffle coming on - I can feel
			it in my bones.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			Dem bones. Dem hones.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, then - how about next week? Come on, chaps - get out your diaries.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			All right. Oh, dem, I've left it behind.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			Behind.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			And besides, I've just remembered, my father's just died and I've got to be at his funeral in
			ten minutes. Dem sorry. Goodbye, your Highness. <br />
			<br />
			<i>Topper exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			Dem. I'm the best man. Dem that dead father! Dem him! Goodbye.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Smedley exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			See you at the ball.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			What a shame they were so busy - would have been lovely to have had them with us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Worried</i>) Us?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You're coming, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, yes, certainly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah. And nothing I can say about the mind-bending horrors of the Revolution will put you off?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, no! Absolutely not. Come on, Blackadder, let's get packing - I want to look my best for
			those fabulous French birds.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, the type of women currently favoured in France are toothless crones who cackle insanely.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, ignore that - they're just playing hard to get.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			By removing all their teeth, going mad and ageing forty years?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			That's right, the little teasers! Well, come on! I think a blend of silks and satins.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I fear not, sir. (<i>Rings bell</i>) If we are to stand any chance of survival, we will have to
			dress as the smelliest low life imaginable.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh yes? What sort of thing?<br />
			<br />
			<i>At which moment, Baldrick fortuitously enters. There is a whisper of the catwalk about his gait.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, sir - let me show you our Paris collection. Baldrick is wearing a sheep's-bladder jacket
			with matching dung-hall accessories. Hair by crazy Meg of Bedlam Hair. Notice how the overpowering
			aroma of rotting pilchards has been woven cunningly into the ensemble. Baldrick, when did you last
			change your trousers?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder crosses to Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I have never changed my trousers.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you. You see the ancient Greeks, your Highness, wrote in legend of a terrible container
			in which all the evils of the world were trapped. How prophetic they were. All they got wrong
			was the name. They called it Pandora's Box', when of course they meant 'Baldrick's Trousers'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			They certainly can get a bit whiffy. there's no doubt about that.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We are told that when the box was opened, the world turned to darkness because of Pandora's
			fatal curiosity. I charge you now, Baldrick, for the good of all mankind, never allow curiosity
			to lead you to open your trousers. Nothing of interest lies therein. However, your Highness, it is trousers exactly like these that you will have to wear, if we are to pass safely into France.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George stares at Baldrick's trousers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes. On second thoughts, Blackadder, you know, I think I might give this all a miss. My tummy's
			playing up a bit. Wish, wish I could come, but just not poss with this turn.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I understand perfectly, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Also, the chances of me scoring if I look and smell like him are zero.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's true, sir. We shall return presently to bid you farewell.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George goes into his bedroom. Blackadder and Baldrick walk out together and into
			the vestibule.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Mr B, I've been having second thoughts about this trip to France.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, why?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, as far as I can see, looking and smelling like this, there's not much chance of me
			scoring either.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And Blackadder hits him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOE II: THE VESTIBULE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is in his cloak ready to leave. Baldrick has two huge bags; Blackadder, a small
			briefcase.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, Blackadder, this is it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir. If I don't make it back, please write to my mother and tell her I have been alive
			all the time, I just couldn't be bothered to get in touch with the old bat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Of course, old man, the very least I can do.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now, we must be gone. The shadows lengthen and we have a long and arduous journey ahead of us.
			Farewell, dear master and, dare I say, friend.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They shake hands and briefly hug.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Farewell, brave liberator and, dare I say it, butler.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He closes the door, almost in tears.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Baldrick enter with their bags from the back door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, stick the kettle on, Balders.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Aren't we going to France?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course we're not going to France. It's incredibly dangerous there.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			So, how are you going to win the bet?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			As always, Baldrick, by the use of the large thing between my ears.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Your nose?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, Baldrick, my brain. All we do is lie low here for a week, then go to Mrs Miggins 's, pick
			up any old French aristocrat, drag him through a puddle, take him to the ball and claim our 1,000 guineas.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But what if the prince finds us here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			He can't find his fly buttons, let alone the kitchen door.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George is unpacking a stupendous pair of trousers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			(<i>To himself</i>) What a pair of trousers! I shall be the belle of the embassy ball...
			How do you get them on? (<i>Shouts</i>) Blackadder! Oh, no, damn! He's gone to France ...
			ah, well, do it myself, shouldn't be too difficult .<br />
			<br />
			<i>He puts them on his arms. On second thoughts it is a pretty tricky manoeuvre.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is one week later. Blackadder and Baldrick are sitting with their feet up. Blackadder
			is smoking a pipe and reading a newspaper.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, Baldrick, what a very pleasant week. We must do this more often.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, I shall certainly choose revolutionary France for my holiday again next year.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			However - time to go to work. Off to Mrs Miggins's to pick up any old French toff.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Loud banging upstairs.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What do you think that could be?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			If I were feeling malicious, I would say the prince was still trying to put his trousers on
			after a week.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George re-enters from his bedroom to the drawing room. The trousers are now on his
			head.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Damn!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He bangs his head on the wall.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: MRS MIGGINS'S COFFEE SHOP</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Blackadder and Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now, Mrs Miggins, I'd like a massive plate of pig's trotters, frogs' legs and snails' ears,
			please, all drenched in your delicious Scarlet Pimpernel Sauce.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Not so hostile to the Frenchies now, Mr B?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Certainly not, Mrs M, I'd sooner be hostile to my own servant. (<i>Slaps Baldrick</i>) In
			fact, I came here specifically to meet lovely Frenehies.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Well, vive to that, and an éclair for both of us!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Vive indeed. Now, what I'm looking for, Mrs M, is a particular kind of Frenchie. Namely, one
			who is transparently of noble blood but also short on cash.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oh, well, I've got just the fellow for you. Over there, by the window, the Comte de Frou Frou.
			Yes, he's pretty down on his luck. He's made that horse's willy last all morning.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Baldrick move over to him. Blackadder is delighted by his find.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We have struck garlic.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He wipes some crumbs off the table on to a plate and hands them to Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			Now you can have some lunch, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He exits with the plate.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Le Comte de Frou Frou, I believe.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Frou Frou looks up.</i><br />
			<br />
			Do you speak English?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frou Frou</b><br />
			A little.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes - when you say a little, what exactly do you mean? Can we talk or are we going to spend
			the rest of the afternoon asking each other the way to the beach in very loud voices.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frou Frou</b><br />
			Oh, no - I can order coffee, deal with waiters, make sexy chit-chat with girls, that type of
			thing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frou Frau</b><br />
			Just don't ask me to take a physiology class or direct a light opera.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, I won't. Now, listen, Frou Frou, would you like to earn some money?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frou Frau</b><br />
			No - I wouldn't. I would like other people to earn it, and then give it to me. Just like in
			France, in the good old days.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, but this is your chance to return to the good old days.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frau Frau</b><br />
			Oh, how I'd love that. I hate this life - the food is filthy. This huge sausage is very suspicious.
			If I didn't know better I'd say it was a horse's ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, yes, all right. The plan is this. I have a bet on with someone that I can get a Frenchman
			out of Paris. I want you to be that Frenchman. All you have to do is come to the embassy party
			with me, say I rescued you and then walk away with 50 guineas and all the vol-au-vents you can
			stuff in your pockets. What do you say?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frou Frau</b><br />
			(<i>Smiling</i>) It will be a pleasure. If there's one thing we aristocrats enjoy, it's a
			fabulous party. Oh, the music, the laughter! If only I had brought my mongoose costume.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is not enthralled.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: THE EMBASSY</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder opens the door, Baldrick and Frou Frou follow him. The atmosphere is a bit odd,
			rather more like a prison cell than an embassy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Frau Frau</b><br />
			Yes - well, obviously the party hasn't really got going yet.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think that's a bit of an understatement, Frou Frou. I've been at autopsies with more party
			atmosphere.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frau Frau</b><br />
			Don't worry. In a moment we will hear the sound of music and happy laughter.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A dramatic sting of music and then a harsh, cruel laugh. A revolutionary appears from the
			shadows of the corridor.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Frenchman</b><br />
			Bonsoir, messieurs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, good evening, my man. Do you speak English?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frenchman</b><br />
			A little.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good. Well just take me to the ambassador then, will you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frenchman</b><br />
			Pardon?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder takes stock, then proceeds slowly and clearly with actions to help the stupid
			foreigner.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I have rescued an aristocrat from the clutches of the evil revolutionaries. Please take me
			to the ambassador.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Frenchman replies slowly and clearly with the same actions.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Frenchman</b><br />
			No, I won't. I am an evil revolutionary and have murdered the ambassador and turned him into
			pâté.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			(<i>As he now is</i>) And you, aristo pig, are trapped.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He and Frou Frou face up like mad things.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Frou Frou</b><br />
			Pig! Ha! You will regret your insolence, revolutionary dog!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			Dog! Ha! You will regret your arrogance, royalist snake!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frou Frou</b><br />
			Snake! Ha! ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Interrupting</i>) Sorry to interrupt this very interesting discussion - but this is
			really none of my business, so I think I'll be on my way. Conic on, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He sets off for the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, not so fast, English.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He blocks his way.</i><br />
			<br />
			In rescuing this 'boite de stinkeeweed', you have attempted to pervert revolutionary justice.
			Do you know what I do to people who do that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			They're given a little present and allowed to go free?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			No...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			They're smacked and told not to be naughty again but basically let off?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			(<i>Raising his hand</i>) I think I know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			They're put in prison for the night and brutally guillotined in the morning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well done, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			Your little gnome is correct, monsieur. Gentlemen, welcome, to the last day of your life.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He locks the door. Frou Frou peers through its bars. It's all gone horribly wrong. Far from
			attending a regal bash, they have ended up in a revolutionary prison in the heart of London.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Frou Frou</b><br />
			How dare you, you filthy weasel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			Weasel! Ha! You're one to talk, aristo warthog.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frou Frou</b><br />
			Warthog! Ha!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Excuse me, Frou Frou.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He pushes Frou Frou out of the way and confidentially addresses the ambassador.</i><br />
			<br />
			Look, mate, mate, me old mate. We're both working class, we both hate these rich bastards,
			come on, me old mucker, just let me go, you've got nothing against me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			On the contrary. I hate you English. With your boring trousers and your shiny toilet paper and
			your ridiculous preconceptions that Frenchmen are great lovers. I'm French and I'm hung like
			a baby carrot and a couple of petits pois. Farewell old muckers and death to the aristos!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Death to the aristos!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Shut up, mousebrain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frou Frau</b><br />
			Monsieur, why waste your words on this scum? Have no fear, the Scarlet Pimpernel will save us.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder pushes Baldrick casually off the bed and sits on it himself.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ha! Some hope - he's the most overrated human being since Judas Iscariot won the AD 31 Best
			Disciple Competition.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frau Frou</b><br />
			Well, if he should fail us - here, I have these suicide pills. One for me (<i>plucks it from
			his ear</i>), one for you (<i>from his nose</i>), and one for the dwarf (<i>from his bottom</i>).<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Say thank you, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Thank you, Mr Frou Fron.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a knock on the door</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Frau Frau</b><br />
			Ah, the Pimpernel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<i>But it is the bloody ambassador who walks in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			No - the ambassador, hurrah. I've got nothing to do, so I think I will torture you aristo mongrel!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frau Frau</b><br />
			Mongrel! Ha! I look forward to it, proletarian skunk!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			Skunk! Ha! We'll see about that, aristocratic happypotamus.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frau Frau</b><br />
			Happypotamus! Ha! We'll see who is the happypotamns, proletarian zebra.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			Zebra! Ha! ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>They exit, shouting.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm glad to say, I don't think you'll be needing those pills, Mr B.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He gives a big smile.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Am I jumping the gun, Baldrick, or are the words 'I have a cunning plan' marching with ill-deserved
			confidence in the direction of this conversation?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			They certainly are.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Forgive me if I don't jump up and down with joy - your record in the cunning-plan department
			is not exactly 100 per cent. So, what's the plan?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			We do nothing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yep. It's another world-beater.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Wait - I haven't finished. We do nothing until our heads have actually been cut off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And then we spring into action?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Exactly! You know when you cut a chicken's head off, it runs round and round the farmyard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yeees.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, we wait until our heads have been cut off then we run round and round the farmyard, out
			the farm gate and escape. What do you think?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My opinion is rather difficult to express in words, so perhaps I can put it this way.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he tweaks Baldrick's nose with vigour.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, well - it doesn't really matter because the Scarlet Pimpernel will save us anyway.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, he won't, Baldrick. Either I think of an idea, or tomorrow we die. Which, Baldrick, I
			have to tell you that I have no intention of doing. I want to be young and wild, and then I
			want to be middle-aged and rich, and then I want to be old and annoy people by pretending I'm
			deaf. Just be quiet and let me think.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: THE CELL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is night. It is dark. It is quiet. Then</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I can't sleep, Mr Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I said 'Shut up'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm so excited. To think that the Scarlet Pimpernel will be here at any moment.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I wish you'd forget this ridiculous fantasy. Even if he did come, the guards would be woken
			by the scraping noise as he squeezes his massive swollen head through the door.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I couldn't sleep when I was little.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You still are little, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, when I was even littler, see, we used to live in a haunted hovel. Every night our family
			was troubled by a visitation from this disgusting ghoul. It was terrible ... first there was
			this unholy smell, then this tiny, hairy, clammy little creature would materialize in the bed
			between them. Fortunately I could never see it myself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. Tell me, Baldrick, when you left home, did this repulsive entity mysteriously disappear?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			(<i>Mysteriously</i>) That very day.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think then that the mystery is solved. Now, shut up. Either I think of an idea or tomorrow
			we meet our maker. In my case, God. In your case, God knows. But I'd be surprised if he's won
			any design awards.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Pause.</i><br />
			<br />
			Wait a minute. I've thought of a plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Also, I've thought of a way to get you to sleep.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Sound of a sharp hit, followed by a clunk from Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWELVE: THE CELL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The next morning. The door opens and the ambassador enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			Good morning, scum. Did you sleep well?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Very confident</i>) Like a top. By jiminee, you must be thirsty after your long night's
			brutality. A drink?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He cunningly and secretly drops two pills into the offered water.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			No, thanks. Not while I'm on duty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Perhaps later?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			For you, monsieur, there is no later. Because, gentlemen, I am proud to introduce France's
			most vicious woman, unexpectedly arrived from Paris this morning. Will you please welcome
			Madame Guillotine herself.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A horrible hag enters, cackling wildly. Half her face is obscured by a large frilly cap.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mme Guillotine</b><br />
			Ha ha ha. Are these the English pigs?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, that's us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mine Guillotine</b><br />
			Leave me with them, Mr Ambassador - I intend to torture them in a way so unbearably gruesome
			even you won't he able to stand it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			I don't think I will have a problem,<i> madame</i>.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mme Guillotine</b><br />
			No, you will be sick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			Well, let me stay for the first few minutes and if I feel queasy, I will leave.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mine Guillotine</b><br />
			You will he sick immediately.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ambassador</b><br />
			What if I am sick quietly in a bag? I mean, what is it exactly you have in mind?<br />
			<br />
			<i>She whispers. The ambassador backs out, gagging.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mme Guillotine</b><br />
			So, scum - prepare to be in pain!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, certainly. But first perhaps, a toast to your beauty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mme Guillotine</b><br />
			Thank you. OK!<br />
			<br />
			<i>She dances forward, takes the cup and swigs it.</i><br />
			<br />
			So, I expect you were expecting to be rescued.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Some bloody hope.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The reply comes in a perfect cut-glass English accent.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mine Guillotine</b><br />
			On the contrary, I'm just sorry I was so late.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What!<br />
			<br />
			Mine Guillotine tears off her frilly cap mid wig. She is not Mine Guillotine at all - she is
			Smedley.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mme Guillotine</b><br />
			Yes, gentlemen, I have come to take you to freedom.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My God - Smedley! But I thought you were an absolute fathead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			Ha ha - no, just a dem fine actor. Thank God I got here before you took any of those awful
			suicide pills.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I suppose, if the person were to take one and wish he hadn't, he'd be able to do something
			about it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			No, they're very odd things. The symptoms are most peculiar - first of all the victims become
			depressed. (<i>Very depressed</i>) Oh, God, this whole Revolution is so depressing. I mean,
			sometimes I wonder why I bother. I'm so lonely, and no one loves me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And after the depression, comes death?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Smedley swaps back with irrational fury.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			No, after the depression comes the loss of temper, you stuck-up bastard. What are you staring
			at? (<i>And thumps Baldrick</i>)<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And after the temper comes death?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			No. After the temper, comes the ... er ...the...er...?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Forgetfulness?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			That's it, the ... er<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Forgetfulness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			That's it. Right in the middle of a thingy you forget what it was you ... ooh, nice pair of
			shoes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And after the forgetfulness you die?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			Oh, no, I forgot one! After the forgetfulness comes a moment of exquisite happiness! Jumping
			up and down and waving your hands and knowing that in a minute we'll be free. Free! Free! Free!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And then death?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smedley</b><br />
			No, you jump into the corner first.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He does and falls down dead in a dark corner.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Hurray, it's the Scarlet Pimpernel!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			And you killed him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, all right. I mean what is the bloody point of being the Scarlet Pimpernel if you're going
			to fall for the old poisoned-cup routine. Scarlet Pimpernel my foot. More like Scarlet Git.
			But wait - this is our chance to escape - quick!!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But what about Mr Frou Frou?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Forget Frou Fron - I wouldn't pick my nose to save his life. Now come on.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They run into the corridor. And bump straight into Frou Frou.</i><br />
			<br />
			Frou Frou, my old friend and comrade. What are you doing here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frou Frou</b><br />
			I escaped. What happened here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Guiltily</i>) Oh nothing, nothing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frou Frou</b><br />
			I thought perhaps for a moment that the Scarlet Pimpernel had saved you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ha! Ha!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Ha! Ha!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THIRTEEN: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder, Frou Frou and Baldrick enter. Prince George is doing up his trousers - the same
			trousers, back to front.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah, chaps - good to see you. Just trying on my trousers.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, I return as promised, plus one top French aristocrat fresh from the Bastille.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			(<i>Bowing</i>) Ah. Pleased to meet you, monsieur, do sit down. Damn sorry about the Revolution
			and all that caper - most awfully bad luck. So tell me, Blackadder, how the devil did you get him out?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, it is an extraordinary tale of courage and heroism which I blush from telling myself.
			But since there is no one else<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I could try.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder clips Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We left England in good weather - but that was as far as our luck held. In the middle of Dover
			harbour, we were struck by a tidal wave and I was forced to swim to Boulogne, with the unconscious
			Baldrick tucked into my trousers. Then we were taken to Paris, where I was summarily tried,
			condemned to death and then hung by the larger of my testicles from the walls of the Bastille.
			It was then that I decided I'd had enough.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The prince is completely engrossed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Bravo!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So I rescued the Comte, killed the guards, jumped the moat, ran to Versailles, where I climbed
			into Mr Robespierre's bedroom, leaving him a small tray of milk chocolates and an insulting note.
			The rest was easy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			That is an incredible story. Worthy of the Scarlet Pimpernel himself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I wouldn't know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frou Frou</b><br />
			I, on the other hand, would. (<i>He stands up</i>) Because you see, sir...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes off his wig and glasses with a flourish. Blackadder closes his eyes in startlement.
			Frou Frou takes off his nose. Baldrick looks amazed. It is Topper.</i><br />
			<br />
			I am the Scarlet Pimpernel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh-oh.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Good Lord. Topper!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			Yes, your Highness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			But egads and by jingo with dumplings, steak and kidneys and a good solid helping of sprouts!
			I can't believe it! You're the fellow who has singlehandedly saved all those dem Frenchies from
			the chop!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			Well, not quite singlehandedly, sir. I operate with the help of my friend Smedley -but he seems
			to have disappeared for the moment, slightly mysteriously.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is about to speak.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Shut up, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, Mr Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			So, Blackadder rescued the Scarlet Pimpernel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			No, sir, he did not.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Eh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			Prepare yourself for a story of dishonour and deceit that will make your stomach turn.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			(<i>Fascinated</i>) I say, this is interesting, isn't it, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder nods.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			Not only that - but I trust it will lead to the imprisonment of a man who is a liar, a bounder
			and a cad.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He stares at Blackadder. Blackadder looks behind him, but he's not joking his way out of
			this one.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, bravo - because we hate liars, bounders and cads, don't we, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Generally speaking, sir, yes. But perhaps before Lord Topper starts to talk he might like a glass
			of wine. He looks a bit shaken.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			Shaken but not stirred.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder goes to the tray. There is the pleasant plop of two suicide pills. Blackadder
			returns and looks on benignly as Topper quaffs his wine.</i><br />
			<br />
			It all began sir, last week. I was sitting in Mrs Miggins's coffee shop when. (<i>Suddenly
			depressed</i>) Oh, God, all this treachery is so depressing. (<i>Then angry</i>) I mean the
			whole thing makes you so incredibly angry!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hits Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			It makes you want to...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He grabs Prince George and starts shaking him. But suddenly he becomes forgetful.</i><br />
			<br />
			Nice waistcoat, your Majesty. Erm, sorry, I've completely forgotten what I was talking about.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A story of dishonour and deceit.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Topper</b><br />
			(<i>Extremely happy</i>) Oh yes - that's a great story! Great! Oh, that's a wonderful story!
			Let me just jump into this corner first.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He does so and dies.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, roast my raisins, he's popped it. I say, Blackadder, do you think he really was the
			Scarlet Pimpernel?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, judging from the ridiculous ostentatiousness of his death, I would say he was.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, that's a damn shame, because I wanted to give him this enormous postal order.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Please, sir, if you'd let me finish. I would say he was ... n't. You see, the Scarlet Pimpernel
			would never, ever, reveal his identity. That's his great secret. So what you're looking for is
			someone who has - say - just been to France and rescued an aristocrat, but when asked: 'Are you
			the Scarlet Pimpernel', he replies, 'Absolutely not.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			But wait a minute, Blackadder, you've just been to France and you've rescued a French
			aristocrat. I say, Blackadder, are you the Scarlet Pimpernel?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder unleashes a huge smile.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Absolutely not, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George gapes with excitement and hands him that postal order.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Hurray!
