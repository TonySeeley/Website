			<b>SCENE ONE: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is polishing shoes. Blackadder enters and adjusts his best neck tie - he is dressed
			more smartly than usual.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You look smart, Mr Blackadder. Going somewhere nice?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No. I'm off to the theatre.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Don't you like it then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, I don't! A load of stupid actors, strutting around shouting with their chests thrust out so
			far you'd think their nipples were attached to a pair of charging elephants. And the worst thing
			about it is having to go with Prince Minibrain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Doesn't he like it either?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, no - he loves it. The problem is he doesn't realize it's made up. Last year, when Brutus was
			about to kill Julius Caesar, the prince yelled 'Look Behind You, Mr Caesar.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I don't see the point of theatre. All that sex and violence. I get enough of that at home. Well,
			apart from the sex, of course.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And while we're out, Baldrick, I want you to give the palace a good clean. It's so dirty, it would
			be unacceptable to a dung-beetle that had lost interest in its career and really let itself go.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The prince calls from outside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Come along, Blackadder! We'll miss the first act.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Coming, sir. Fast as I can.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He sits down with his legs up.</i><br />
			<br />
			Stick the kettle on, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE THEATRE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Two actors are on stage in Egyptian garb, fighting with sword and knife. Quite a lot of
			overacting involved.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Now, sir, I give this advice to thee. Never, never, never trust thine enemy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Keanrick draws his sword and stabs Mossop very unrealistically through the armpit. Prince George
			is horror-struck. Mossop sinks to the floor.</i><br />
			<br />
			Thy life is forfeit, sir ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Aaaagh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Keanrick kicks Mossop - he is supposed to be dead - and begins his closing speech once more.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Thy life is forfeit, sir, and at an end. Like our poor play...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns to the audience with a grand flourish.</i><br />
			<br />
			We hope we pleased you, friends.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George answers from the box.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Certainly not, you murdering rotter. Guards - arrest that man!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Your Highness - it's only a play.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			That's all very well but what about the poor fellow who's dead? Saying 'it's only a play' won't
			feed and clothe the little ones he leaves behind. Call the militia!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But he's not dead: see, he stands, awaiting your applause.<br />
			<br />
			<i>As indeed he does.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh I say, that's very clever! I thought he was really dead. Bravo! Bravo!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The prince's applause sets off the whole audience clapping. On stage, Keanrick and Mossop are
			taking a bow. Keanrick whispers to Mossop.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Blast! The prince likes it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Shit! We'll close tonight.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Suddenly, a wild-eyed anarchist jumps up on stage. He shouts at the royal box.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Anarchist</b><br />
			Work for the weavers! Smash the Spinning Jenny! Burn the Rolling Rosalind! Destroy the Going-Up-
			and-Down-and-Then-Moving-Along-a-Bit Gertrude! And death to the stupid prince who grows fat on
			the profits!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hurls a fizzing bomb into the box and jumps offstage. Prince George catches the bomb in
			very high spirits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I say, how exciting! The play's getting better and better. Bravo!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is sensibly hiding behind the curtains.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's not a play any more, sir. Just put the bomb down and make your way quietly to the exit.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, Blackadder - you silly old thing - your problem is you can't tell when something's real and
			when it's not!<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a very big explosion.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George is on the chaise longue bandaged up and eating heartily. Blackadder is attending
			him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I must say, Blackadder, that was a close shave. Why on earth should an anarchist possibly want
			to kill you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think it might have been you he was after, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, hogwash - what on earth makes you say that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, sir, my suspicious were first aroused by his use of the words 'Death to the Stupid Prince.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			That was a bit rude, wasn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			These are volatile times, your Highness, the American Revolution lost your royal father the
			colonies, the French Revolution murdered brave King Louis, and there have been tremendous
			rumblings in Prussia, although that might be something to do with the sausages. The whole world
			cries out, 'Peace, freedom and a few less fat bastards eating all the pie.'<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George muses thoughtfully on the pie in his hand.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, yes quite. Something must be done. Any ideas?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir. Next week it is your royal father's birthday celebrations - I suggest that I write a
			brilliant speech for you to recite, to show the oppressed masses how unusually sensitive you are.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder holds some smelling salts under the prince's nose to help him in his fragile state.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Euch! But tell me more about these oppressed masses - what are they so worked up about?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			They are worked up, sir, because they are so poor they're forced to have children simply to
			provide a cheap alternative to turkey at Christmas. Disease and deprivation stalk our land
			like two giant stalking things and the working man is poised to overthrow us.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters, holding a bucket and broom. Prince George jumps up and tries to hide in
			front of the fireplace.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, my God - and here he is!!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't he silly, that's Baldrick, my dogs-body.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			What's silly about that? he looks like an oppressed mass to me. Get him out of here at once.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Shoo, Baldrick. Carry on with your cleaning elsewhere. By the end of the night, I want the dining
			table so clean I could eat my dinner off it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick exits with resignation.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Crikey, Blackadder. I'm dicing with death here. The sooner I show how unusually sensitive I am,
			the better. (<i>he burps</i>) Oh! And I've just had another brilliant thought!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Another one, your Highness?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, actually, another one. Remember the one I had about wearing underwear on the outside to
			save on laundry bills? Well this time I'm thinking - 'hello, why don't we ask those two actor
			chappies we saw tonight to teach me how to recite your speech.' Brilliant, eh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: MRS MIGGINS'S COFFEE SHOP</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Mrs Miggins is behind the counter. Blackadder enters the shop.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mrs Miggins. I'm looking for a couple of actors.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Well, you've come to the right place, Mr B. There's more Shakespearian dialogue in here than
			there are buns. All my lovely actors pop in on their way to rehearsals for a little cup of
			coffee and a big dollop of inspiration.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She hands Blackadder a coffee.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You mean they actually rehearse? I thought they just got drunk, stuck on silly hats and
			trusted to luck.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oooh, no - there's ever so much hard work goes into the wonderful magic that is theatre today.
			Still, I don't expect you'd know much about that, being only a little butler.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She chucks him on his cheek. He's getting annoyed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			They do say, Mrs M, that verbal insults hurt more than physical pain. They are, of course,
			wrong as you will soon discover when I stick this toasting fork in your head.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The door flies open - there is a bellow from outside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Ladies and gentlemen, would you please welcome Mr David Keanrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			And the fabulous Mr Enoch Mossop.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They enter grandly to general cheers. Blackadder is not impressed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Settle down, settle down.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			No autographs, please.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			My usual, Mrs M.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Coming up, my lovie.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			If I can squeeze through the admiring rabble here (<i>No one actually</i>), gentlemen, I've
			come with a proposition.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			How dare you, sir! You think just because we're actors we sleep with everyone.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think being actors you're lucky to sleep with anyone. I come here on behalf of my employer
			to ask for some elocution lessons.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			I fear, sir, that is quite impossible. We are in the middle of rehearsing our new play - we
			could not possibly betray our beloved audience by taking time off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Oh, no - never upset the punters. Bums on seats, laddie, bums on seats.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what play is this?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			It is a piece we penned ourselves, called The Bloody Murder of the Foul Prince Romero and
			His Enormously Bosomed Wife.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A philosophical work, then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Indeed, yes. The violence of the murder and the vastness of the bosom are entirely justified
			artistically.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right - well I'll tell the prince you can't make it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder stands to go, now he has their total attention.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			The prince?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, yes, didn't I mention that? Yes, it's the Prince Regent. Shame you can't make
			it. Still.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mossop pushes Keanrick off his chair and propels Blackadder into it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Sir, wait, wait. I think perhaps we could find ... a little time. Don't you think, Mr Keanrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Definitely, Mr Mossop.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, no, you've got your beloved audience to think about.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Sod the proles, sir. We'll come.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Yes. Worthless bastards to a man.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's nice to see artistic integrity thriving so strongly in the acting community. This afternoon
			at four then, at the palace.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder knocks and enters. Prince George's face is made up like the actors were earlier -
			ridiculous red cheeks and huge moustache. He is also wearing a toga.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well. What do you think?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Are you ill or something?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			No, I was simply trying to look more like an actor.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I'm sure you don't need the false moustache, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			No?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder grabs the moustache and yanks it viciously. The prince screams with pain, then
			goes to a cupboard to put the moustache away. When he opens the door, he finds Baldrick inside.</i><br />
			<br />
			Egads! It's that oppressed mass again!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The prince drags Baldrick out of tile cupboard and starts to strangle him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No - that is Baldrick spring-cleaning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, yes, so it is.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Finish the job later, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Certainly, sir. The cleaning or the being strangled?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Either suits me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Look, Blackadder. This is all getting a hit hairy, isn't it? I mean, are you sure we can even
			trust these acting fellows. The last time we went to the theatre, three of them murdered Julius
			Caesar - and one of them was his best friend, Brutus.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			As I've told you about eight times - the man playing Julius Caesar was an actor called Kemp.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Thundering gherkins! Brutus must have been pretty miffed when he found out.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, that he hadn't killed Caesar after all, but just some poxy actor called Kemp.<br />
			<br />
			<i>This elicits a very exasperated look from Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			What do you think he did, go round to Caesar's place after the play and kill him then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Not very under his breath</i>) Oh, God, it's pathetic.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is cleaning silver at the table. There is a loud sound of knocking above. He vaguely
			looks up. Even more knocking. Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Is that the door?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. But don't worry, it's only the actors.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder helps himself to some tea and sits down. The knocking continues.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My uncle Baldrick was in a play once.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes. It was called Macbeth.<br />
			<br />
			<i>More knocking</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what did he play?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Second codpiece. Macbeth wore him in the fight scenes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Even, more knocking and even more ignoring of it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So he was a stunt codpiece.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, that's right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Did he have a large part?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Depends who was playing Macbeth.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Incidentally, Baldrick, actors are very superstitious so on no account mention the word 'Macbeth'
			this evening.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Why not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Because it brings them bad luck and makes them very unhappy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			So you won't be mentioning it either?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No. Well, not very often, anyway.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: THE VESTIBIULE AND PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Keanrick and Mossop enter and brush past Blackadder</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You should have knocked.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Our knocks, you impertinent butler, were loud enough to wake the hounds of hell.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They throw their hats at Blackadder who catches them ... and throws them straight out the
			front door The actors go into the chambers and Blackadder follows.</i><br />
			<br />
			Lead on, Macduff.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			I shall - lest you continue in your quotation and speak the name of the Scottish play.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Oho! Never fear, I shan't do that.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			By the Scottish play, I suppose you mean Macbeth.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A moment of utter horror from the two actors, followed by a violent and stupid superstitious
			routine.</i><br />
			<br />
			What was that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Exorcizing evil spirits. Being only a butler you will know not of the great theatre tradition
			that one does never speak the name of the Scottish play.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What, Macbeth?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They do the superstitious stupidity again.</i><br />
			<br />
			Good Lord, you mean you have to do that every time I say 'Macbeth'?<br />
			<br />
			<i>And they do it again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Will you please stop saying that. Always call it 'the Scottish play'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So you want me to say 'the Scottish play'?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Both</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Rather than Macbeth?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They do it again. Prince George enters from his bedroom.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			For heaven's sake. What is all this hullabaloo out here, shouting and screaming and yelling
			blue murder?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mossop and Keanrick bow.</i><br />
			<br />
			Why, it's like that play we saw the other day, what was it called ...?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Macbeth, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And once again the actors do their routine.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			No, it wasn't - it was called Julius Caesar.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course. It was Julius Caesar ... not Macbeth.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The poor actors go through the ritual once more.</i><br />
			<br />
			Are you sure you want these people to stay?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Of course - I asked them, didn't I, Mr Thicky Butler?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Your Highness, may we say what an honour it is to he invited here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Why certainly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Thank you. What a great honour it is to he invited here, to make merry in the halls of our
			king's loins' most glorious outpouring.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George screws up his face in disgust at these words.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Now, your Highness, shall we begin straight away?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Certainly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Before we inspect the script, let us have a look at stance.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Right, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			The ordinary fellow stands like this ... as you do now.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He stands casually.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			But the hero - stands ... thus!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Both actors spread their legs a good three feet and strike heroic poses.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah. So more like... this.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He makes a very feeble attempt.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Excellent, sire, but even more.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Like ... this.<br />
			<br />
			<i>All three stand with legs ridiculously apart. There is a creak.</i><br />
			<br />
			What was that noise?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			It wasn't me. We're used to standing in this position.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			It came from...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He flings open a chest Baldrick is polishing. Prince George is terrified.</i><br />
			<br />
			Anarchist!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Cleaner!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			All right, so you've had a wash. That's no excuse.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters calmly. Prince George starts to strangle Baldrick again.</i><br />
			<br />
			Die, traitor!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's Baldrick, your Highness, still spring-cleaning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Rubbish, look - he's got a bomb.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's not a bomb, sir, it's a sponge.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			So it is. Well, get out of here at once before it explodes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			Now then, stance. I really think we had something there.<br />
			<br />
			<i>All three spread their legs even further.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Bravo. Your very posture tells me, 'Here is a man of true greatness.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Either that or, 'Here are my genitals, please kick them.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Sir, I really must ask that this ill-educated oaf be removed from the room.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Yes - get out, sir. Your presence here is as useful as fine bone china at a tea party for
			drunken elephants.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Is that right? Well then, yes, hang it all! Get out, Blackadder, and stop corking our juices.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Very well, your Highness - I'll leave you to dribble on in private.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder exits, and he is annoyed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters with an annoyed grunt. Baldrick is cleaning the floor.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Something wrong, Mr Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yup. I've had it just about up to here with the prince. One more insult and I'll be handing
			in my notice.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Does that mean I'll be the butler?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not unless a kindly passing surgeon cuts your head open with a spade and sticks a new brain in it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, fine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I don't know why I put up with it, I really don't. Every year at the Guild of Butlers Christmas
			Party, I'm the one who has to wear the red nose and the pointy hat for winning the 'Who's Got
			The Stupidest Master' competition. All I can say is, he'd better watch out. One more foot wrong,
			and the contract between us will be as broken as this milk jug.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He picks up a milk jug.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But that jug isn't broken.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You really do walk into these things, don't you, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He smashes the jug over Baldrick's head, picks up a tray and walks out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George is standing as before, legs spectacularly apart. and wearing the most
			contorted of grins. The actors are lounging.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Excellent. And now, sir, at last - the speech.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Right. (<i>Little cough</i>) 'Th...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			No, no - your Royal Highness - what have you forgotten?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Look, if I stand any more heroically than this I'm in danger of seriously disappointing my
			future queen.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Not the stance - the roar.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			You want me to roar?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Well, of course we wish you to roar. All great orators roar before commencing their speeches.
			It is the way of things. Mr Keanrick, from your Hamlet...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Keanrick takes a stance, then...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			'Oooooooooo, to be or not to be...'<br />
			<br />
			<i>Definitely a roar.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			From your Julius Caesar.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			'Otoooo, friends, Rornans, countrymen...'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			From your leading character in a play connected with Scotland.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters casually.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's Macbeth, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The actors do the ritual once more.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			So, let's roar, shall we? One, two, three...<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all roar, Prince George loudest of all.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Excellent, your Highness. Now, shall we try putting it all together?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George does the stance, the facial expression, gives the loudest roar of all and says
			very blandly:</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			'Unaccustomed as I am ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			No, sire. Alas, you mew it like a frightened tree. May I ... see the speech?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes it and he and Mossop form a huddle. They read it and start sniggering.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick and Mossop</b><br />
			No, no, no. Dear me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Who wrote this drivel?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Is there a problem with the speech?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick and Mossop</b><br />
			Problem?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They both laugh.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, there is a problem - the problem is that you wrote it, Mr Hopelessly Drivelo-Can't-Write-
			For-Toffee-Crappy-Butler-Weed.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder drops his tray.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Whoops!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He exits. Perhaps for the last time.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters. Baldrick is scrubbing the steps.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Shall I get their supper, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. Preferably something that has first passed through the digestive system of the cat. And
			you'll have to take it up yourself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Why?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Because I'm leaving, Baldrick. I am about to enter the job market. Let's see.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He picks up a newspaper and settles for a good read.</i><br />
			<br />
			Situations Vacant: Mr and Mrs Pitt are looking for a baby minder to take Pitt the Younger to
			parliament. Some fellow called Stephenson has invented a moving kettle - wants someone to help
			with the marketing. And there's a foreign opportunity here. 'Treacherous, malicious,
			unprincipled cad, preferably non-smoker, wanted to be King of Sardinia. No time-wasters please.
			Apply to: Napoleon Bonaparte, P0 Box 1, Paris.' Right. We're on our way.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: THE DINING ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George and the actors are at supper.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Sir, about costume. Any thoughts?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, enormous trousers certainly. Then I thought perhaps an admiral's uniform, because we
			know what all the nice girls love, don't we? Tell you what - why don't I go and try them on
			for you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			What a super idea.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Help yourselves to wine - you'll need a stiff drink when you see the size of these damn trousers.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George leaves.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			My dear, what a ghastly evening.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			You're so right, love.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			While he's gone, let's have a quick read through of The Bloody Murder of the Foul Prince Romero
			and His Enormously Bosomed Wife.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Act one, Scene one.
			'Spring is come with all its gentle showers, Methinks 'tis time to hack the prince to death...'<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWELVE: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is all packed and ready to go, with hat and cape on.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, I would like to say how much I will miss your honest, friendly companionship.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Thank you, Mr B.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But, as we both know, it would be an utter lie. I will therefore confine myself to saying simply,
			'Sod off and if I ever meet you again, it will be twenty billion years too soon.'<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he leaves for ever...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Goodbye, you lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Or not. Blackadder reappears in the doorway.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I fear, Baldrick, you'll soon be eating those badly chosen words. I wouldn't bet a single groat
			that you could survive five minutes here without me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, come on, Mr B - it's not as if we're going to be murdered or anything the minute you leave,
			is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hope springs eternal, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he leaves again. The bell rings.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Coming!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THIRTEEN: CORRIDOR AND DINING ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick walks along the corridor towards the dining room. He is about to knock but he hears
			the actors talking very loudly. They don't notice him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Let's kill the prince.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Who shall strike first?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Let me - and let this dagger's point prick his soft eyeball and sup with glee on its exquisite
			jelly.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is terrified at what he has heard.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Have you the stomach?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			I haven't killed him yet, sir, But when I do, I shall have the stomach And the liver too, And
			the floppily doppilies in their horrid gloo.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			What if a servant should hear us in our plotting?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Ha ha! Then we shall have servant sausages for tea, And servant rissoles shall our supper be.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick runs for it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOURTEEN: PRINCE CEORCE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George is trying on his big trousers. Baldrick charges in, terrified and yelling.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Murder! Murder! The revolution's started.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			What!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He draws his sword and gets Baldrick by the throat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			A plot, sir, a plot to kill you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah ha - so you've come clean at last, have you, you bloody little poor person.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, not me - it's the actors downstairs - they're anarchists.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Anarchists?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I heard them plotting, sir. They are going to poke out your liver and turn me into a rissole.
			And then suck on your exquisite floppily doppilies.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			What are we going to do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, Mr Blackadder always says, when the going gets tough, the tough hide under the table.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Blackadder! Of course! Where is he?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			He's in Sardinia.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			What? Why!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, you were rude to him. So he left.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, no! What a mad blundering, incredibly handsome young nincompoop I've been! Oh, God! What can
			we do? If we go downstairs, they'll chop us up and eat us alive. Oh. God - we're doomed, doomed,
			doomed!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They hear footsteps in the distance, getting closer. They both cower Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good evening, your Highness. (<i>He consults his watch</i>) Four minutes and 22 seconds, Baldrick.
			You owe me a groat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Thank God you're here. We desperately need you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Who, me, sir? Mr Thicky Black Thicky Adder Thicky.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Doh! Tish! Nonsense!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mr Hopelessly-Drivelo-Can't-Write-ForToffee-Crappy-Butler-Weed?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, well.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mr Brilliantly-Undervalued-Butler-Who-Hasn't-Had-a-Raise-For-a-Fortnight?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Take an extra thousand ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder inspects his nails casually.</i><br />
			<br />
			... guineas ... per month?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right - what's the problem?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			The actors have turned out to be vicious anarchists.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is a touch sceptical.</i><br />
			<br />
			They intend to kill us all.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What are they going to do - bore us to death?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			No - stab us. Baldrick overheard them.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I did.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Are you sure they meant it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, quite sure. Baldrick, how far apart were their legs?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick demonstrates.</i><br />
			<br />
			Their nipples?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick demonstrates.</i><br />
			<br />
			They meant it all right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Very well, sire, I'll see what I can do.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIFTEEN: CORRIDOR AND DINING ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder reaches the door to the dining room and listens.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			To torture him I lust And singe his hair and up his nostrils Hot bananas thrust.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters blithely.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Rehearsals going well, gentlemen?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			Be gone - a mere butler with the intellectual capacity of a squashed apricot can be of no help
			to us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Exactly, sir - your participation is as irritating as a potted cactus in a monkey's pyjamas.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder responds very politely.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, well, in that case I won't interrupt you any longer. Sorry to disturb, gentlemen.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIXTEEN: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George and Baldrick are hiding under the table. Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Blackadder - thank God you're safe. What happened?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sire - there was no need for you to panic. It was all perfectly straightforward.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			They're traitors, sir, and must be arrested, brutally tortured and then executed forthwith.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Bravo!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVENTEEN: THE DINING ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Two soldiers have Mossop and Keanrick bound. Blackadder, Baldrick and Prince George look on.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mossop</b><br />
			But, your Highness, there's been a terrible mistake.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's what they were bound to say, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			It was a play. A play! Look sire, all the words you heard written down on paper.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Text book stuff again. The criminals' vanity always makes them make one tiny but fatal mistake.
			Theirs was to have their entire conspiracy printed and published in play manuscript form. Take
			them away.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The actors are led out, bound - and bound for certain death.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Keanrick</b><br />
			Alas, sir, alas. We beg for mercy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I've only one thing to say to you. 'Macbeth'.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They react accordingly and are dragged away.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well done, Bladders. What can I do to thank you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You could start by not calling me Bladders, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shouts into the hall.</i><br />
			<br />
			Macbeth!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Of course, Bladders - no sooner said than done. And no hard feelings?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Absolutely none, sir. I'm glad to be back in the saddle - did I say 'saddle'? I meant harness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Bravo! So, we're the best of friends as ever we were?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Absolutely, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			In fact, sir, now that the anarchists Keanrick and Mossop have got their comeuppancc, Drury
			Lane is free tonight and I thought we might celebrate by staging a little play that I've written.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, what an excellent idea. And with my new-found skills, might there be a part in it for me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I was hoping that you might play the title role, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			What a roaringly good idea. What's the play called?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thick Jack Clot Sits in the Stocks and Gets Pelted with Rancid Tomatoes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Excellent!!
