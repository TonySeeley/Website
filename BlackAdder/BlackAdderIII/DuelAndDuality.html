			<b>SCENE ONE: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder walks in and goes straight to his corner, ignoring Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Ooh, Mr Blackadder!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Leave me alone, Baldrick. If I'd wanted to talk to a vegetable I would have bought one at the market.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			So, you don't want this message?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He holds up a piece of paper</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, thank you. God, I'm wasted here.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He flops into his chair Life is just not worth the living.</i><br />
			<br />
			It's no life for a man of noble blood, servant to a master with all the intellect of a jugged walrus
			and all the social graces of a potty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm wasted too. I've been thinking about bettering myself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, really - how?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, I applied for the job of village idiot of Kensington.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Get anywhere?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I got down to the last two, but I failed the final interview.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What went wrong.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I turned up. The other bloke was such an idiot he forgot to.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. Well, I'm afraid my ambitions stretch slightly further than professional idiocy in West London.
			I want to be remembered when I'm dead. I want books written about me. I want songs sung about me.
			And then, hundreds of years from now, I want episodes from my life to be played out weekly at 9.30
			by some great heroic actor of the age.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes. And I could be played by some tiny tit in a heard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Quite. Now, what's this message?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I thought you didn't want it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I may do - it depends what it is.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			So you do want it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I don't know, do I? It depends on what it is.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			(<i>Getting panicky</i>) Well I can't tell you what it is unless you want to know, and you said
			you didn't want to know, and now I'm so confused I don't know where I live or what my name is!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Your name is of no importance and you live in the pipe in the upstairs water closet.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He gets up and snatches the letter from the kitchen table.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, no. Was the man who gave you this by any chance a red-headed lunatic with a kilt and a claymore?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, and the funny thing is, he looks exactly like you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God, my mad cousin MacAdder, the most dangerous man ever to wear a skirt in Europe.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yeh - he came in here playing the bagpipes, then made a haggis, sang 'Auld Lang Syne' and punched
			me in the face.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Why?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Because I called him a knock-kneed Scottish pillock.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			An unwise action, Balders, since Mad MacAdder is a homicidal maniac.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My mother told me to stand up to homicidal maniacs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Baldrick, if this is the same mother who confidently claims that you are a tall handsome
			stallion of a man, I should treat her opinions with extreme caution.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I love my mum.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I love chops and sauce but I don't seek their advice. (<i>Looks at the letter</i>) Oh, God, I
			hate it when MacAdder turns up - he's such a frog-eyed, beetle-browed, basket case.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			He's the spitting image of you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Rattled</i>) No, he is not. We're about as similar as two completely dissimilar things in a
			pod. Now what's the old tartan throwback banging on about this time? (<i>Skimming letter</i>)
			'Have come south for rebellion' ... oh, God, surprise surprise. 'Staying with Miggins ... the
			time has come ... best sword in Scotland Insurrection ... blood ... large bowl of porridge ...
			rightful claim to throne' (<i>Screws up letter</i>) He's mad! He's mad. He's madder than Mad
			Jack McMad, the winner of this year's Mr Madman competition.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The bell rings.</i><br />
			<br />
			Ah! The walrus awakes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes off the prince's cloak.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCEINE TWO: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters, carrying the breakfast tray, which he sets down on the table in the living
			room.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah, Blackadder. Notice anything unusual?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir, it's 11.30 in the morning and you're moving about. Is the bed on fire?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, I wouldn't know. I've been out all night. Guess what I've been doing? Gorrrr!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Beagling, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Better even than that, Blackadder. Sink me, Blackadder, if I haven't just had the most wonderful
			evening of my life.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder could not be less enthusiastic.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Tell me all, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, as you know, when I set out I looked divine. At the party, as I passed, all eyes turned.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Flatteringly</i>) And I dare say, quite a few stomachs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, that's right - but then these two ravishing beauties came over to me and whispered in my
			ear that they loved me.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He leans provocatively against the door, and then wanders into the bedroom.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what happened after you woke up, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The prince throws himself luxuriously onto the bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			This was no dream, Blackadder. Five minutes later I was in a coach flying through the London
			night bound for the ladies' home.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Which ladies' home is this - a home for the elderly or a home for the mentally disadvantaged?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			No. It was Apsley House - do you know it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Worried</i>) Yes, sir, it is the seat of the Duke of Wellington. Those ladies I fancy would
			be his nieces.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			So you fancy them too. Don't blame you. Bravo! I spent a night of ecstasy with a pair of
			Wellingtons and I loved it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. It might interest you to know, sir, that the Iron Duke has always let it be known that he
			will kill in cold blood anyone who takes sexual advantage of any of his relatives.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, yes, but Big Nose Wellington is in Spain fighting the French - he'll never know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			On the contrary, sir. Wellington triumphed six months ago.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I'm dead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It would seem so, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I haven't got a prayer, have I, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Against throat-slasher Wellington, the finest blade his Majesty commands? Not really, no.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He gets up - his life now at stake.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Then I shall flee. How's your French, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Parfait, monsieur, but I fear France is not far enough.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			How's your Mongolian?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Chang-ha-tang, matso moto. But I fear Wellington is a close personal friend of the chief Mongol.
			They were at Eton together.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I'm doomed, doomed as the dodo!<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a knock on the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, my God, he's here. Wellington's here already.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters. Prince George throws himself at Baldrick's feet.</i><br />
			<br />
			Forgive me, your Grace, forgive. I didn't know what I was doing - I was a mad, mad, sexually
			over - active fool.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, it's Baldrick. You are perfectly safe.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder has taken Baldrick's message.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Until six o'clock tonight.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			(<i>Subdued</i>) Hurooo.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Which is the opposite of hurrah!</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			From the Supreme Commander, Allied Forces, Europe. 'Sir, prince or pauper, when a man soils a
			Wellington, he puts his foot in it. Open brackets, this is not a joke, I do not find my name
			remotely funny and people who do end up dead, close brackets. I challenge you to a duel tonight
			in which you will die. Yours, with sincere apologies for your impending violent slaughter,
			Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Sounds a nice, polite sort of bloke.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George starts to cry.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't worry, sir, please just consider that life is a valley of woe filled with pain, misery,
			hunger and despair.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Not for me it bloody isn't. As far as I'm concerned, life is a big palace full of food, drink
			and comfy sofas.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick has been lurking at the door. He has an idea.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			May I speak, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Certainly not, Baldrick. The prince is about to die - the last thing he wants is to spend his
			final moments exchanging pleasantries with a certified plum duff.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Easy, Blackadder - let's hear him out.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Very well, Baldrick, we shall hear you out, then throw you out. Speak.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, your Majesty, there is a cunning plan by which you could get out of this problem.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't listen to him, sir. It's a cruel proletarian trick to raise your hopes - I shall have him
			shot the moment he's finished clearing away your breakfast.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Wait, Blackadder. Perhaps this disgusting, degraded creature may be a blessing in disguise.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			If he is, it's a very good disguise.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			After all, did not Our Lord send a lowly earthworm to comfort Moses in his torment?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Hmm, well it's the sort of thing he might have done. Come on, Mr Spotty, speak.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Very well, your Majesty - I just thought, this Wellington bloke's been in Europe for years. You
			don't know what he looks like, he don't know what you looks like. So why don't you get someone
			else to fight the duel instead of you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			But I'm the Prince Regent! My portrait hangs on every wall.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Answer that, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, my cousin Bert Baldrick, Mr Gainsborongh's butler's dogshody, says he heard that all
			portraits look the same these days, since they are painted to a romantic ideal, rather than
			as a true depiction of the idiosyncratic facial qualities of the person in question.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Your cousin Bert obviously has a larger vocabulary than you do, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			(<i>Excited</i>) But he's right, damn him! Anybody could fight the duel ... Wellers would never
			know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All the same, sir, Baldrick's plan seems to hinge on finding someone willing to commit suicide
			on your behalf.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, yes, yes, yes, but he would be fabulously rewarded! Money, titles, a castle ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That's right. I thought maybe Mr Blackadder himself would fancy the job.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George What a splendid idea!</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Excuse me, your Highness, trouble with the staff.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: THE VESTIBULE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters with Baldrick held firmly by the scruff of the neck.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, does it have to he this way? Our valued friendship ending with me cutting you up into
			strips and telling the prince that you walked over a very sharp cattle grid in an extremely
			heavy hat?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But Mr Blackadder, you were only saying in the kitchen how you want to rise again, and here the
			prince is, offering the lot.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But tiny, tiny brain, the Iron Duke would kill me! To even think about taking him on you'd have
			to be some kind of homicidal maniac who was fantastic at fighting, like my cousin MacAdder.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And into his head pops a cunning plan.</i><br />
			<br />
			MacAdder! MacAdder can fight the duel for me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder re-enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My apologies, sir. I was just having a word with my insurance people and obviously I would be
			delighted to die on your behalf.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			God's toenails, Blackadder, I'm most damnably grateful. You won't regret this, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Excellent, sir. Just one point sir, re: the suicide policy. There is a duelling clause that
			requires the policy holder to wear a big red wig and affect a Scottish accent in the combat
			zone.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Small print, eh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: MRS MICCINS'S COFFEE SHOP</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is in chaos - full of tartans and swords, and Mrs Miggins is lying against the bar as
			Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, Miggins - am I to assume by your look of pie-eyed exhaustion and the globules of porridge
			hanging off the walls that my cousin MacAdder has presented his credentials?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Ooh! He has indeed, sir! You've just missed him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I hope he's been practising with his clay-more.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			I should say so. I'm as weary as a dog with no legs that's just climbed Ben Nevis.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A claymore is a sword, Mrs Miggins.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mrs Miggins points to a wood carving which is just behind her up on the bar.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			See this intricate wood carving of the Infant Samuel at prayer? He whittled that with the tip
			of his mighty weapon with his eyes closed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Unimpressed</i>) Exquisite.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			He bid me bite on a plank, there was a whirlwind of steel and within a minute three men lay
			dead and I had a lovely new set of gnashers.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Really. Well, just tell him to meet me here at five o'clock to discuss an extremely cunning plan.
			If all goes well, tomorrow the clan of MacAdder will be marching on the highroad back to glory!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oooh, that's lovely. I'll do you a nice packed lunch.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good news, your Highness. By evening, I shall have carved the duke into an attractive piece of
			furniture with some excellent dental work.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He then realizes Prince George isn't about. Your Highness?</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>He suddenly notices Prince George behind the bedroom door with his fingers in his ears.</i><br />
			<br />
			Your Highness?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, thank God it's you, Blackadder. I've just had word from Wellington. He's on his way here now.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's awkward. The duke must believe that I am you from the very start.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Any ideas?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			There's no alternative, sir, we must swap clothes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, yes - fantastic!! Dressing up - I love it! It's just like that story - 'The Prince and the
			Porpoise'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And the Pauper.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, yes - 'The Prince and the Porpoise and the Pauper'. Jolly good stuff.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is now wearing the prince's coat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Excellent, excellent - why, my own father wouldn't recognize me!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Your own father never can, he's mad.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Unfortunately, sir, you do realize that I shall have to treat you like a servant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, I think I can cope with that, Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And you'll have to get used to calling me your Highness', your Highness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			'Your Highness, your Highness.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, just 'your Highness', your Highness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			That's what I said - 'your Highness, your Highness', your Highness, your Highness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, let's just leave that for now, shall we? Complicated stuff obviously.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick rushes in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Big Nose is here.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He is totally flummoxed by the cunning switch of identities.</i><br />
			<br />
			But what? Who? Where? How?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't even try to work it out, Baldrick. Two people you know well have exchanged coats, and now
			you don't know which is which.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I must say I'm pretty confused myself. Which one of us is Wellington?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Wellington is the man at the door.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh. And the porpoise ...?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hasn't arrived yet. We'll just have to fill in as best we can without him. Sir, if you would
			let the duke in.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George goes to the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Certainly, your Highness, your Highness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right - and you better get out too, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, your Highness, your Highness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God. If only they had a brain cell between them.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter the Duke of Wellington, a tall, red-faced, arrogant-looking soldier. Prince George
			announces him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			The Duke of Wellington.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			(<i>Rowing to Blackadder</i>) Have I the honour of addressing the Prince Regent, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You do.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Congratulations, Highness, your hearing is far nobler than I had been informed. (<i>To Prince
			George</i>) Take my coat at once, sir, lest you wish to feel my boot in your throat, and be
			quicker about it than you were with the door.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Wellington clips him for luck.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			I'm a duke, not a lord! Where were you trained? A dago's dancing class? Shall I have my people
			thrash him for you, your Highness?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder pauses. Prince George is getting very worried.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Umm, no, he's very new. At the moment I'm sparing the rod.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Fatal error, sir. Give 'em an inch and before you know it they've got a foot - much more of
			that and you don't have a leg to stand on! Get out!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He whacks Prince George again.</i><br />
			<br />
			Now then, sir, to business. I am informed that your royal father grows ever more eccentric and
			at present he believes himself to be (<i>reads from a paper he is holding</i>) 'a small village
			in Lincolnshire commanding spectacular views of the Nene Valley'. I therefore pass my full
			account of the war on to you, the Prince of Wales.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hands over a heavy saddle bag. Blackadder takes out a very small piece of paper and reads ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, that's excellent, thank you. 'We won. Signed Wellington.' Right, well that seems to sum things
			up. Anything else?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Two other trifling affairs, sir. The men had a whip round and got you this. Well, what I mean
			is, I had the men roundly whipped until they got you this. A cigarillo case, engraved with the
			regimental crest of two crossed dead Frenchmen emblazoned over a mound of dead Frenchmen motif.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you very much. And the other trifling thing?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Your impending death, Highness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, yes, of course. Mind like a sieve.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			I cannot deny, I am looking forward to it. Britain has the finest trade, the finest army, the
			finest navy in the world. And what have we for royalty? A mad Kraut sausage-sucker and a son
			who can't keep his sausage to himself. The sooner you're dead the better.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You're very kind.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Now then, no doubt you are anxious to catch up with the latest news of the war. I have here the
			most recent briefs from my generals in the field.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, well, if you could just pop them in the laundry basket on the way out.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He gets up, rings the bell, and they both sit down at the table, where Wellington is
			spreading out a map.</i><br />
			<br />
			Tea?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Yes, immediately. Now let's turn to the second front, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			As I understand it, Napoleon is in North Africa. And Nelson is stationed in ...?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Alaska, your Highness. In case Boney should trick us by coming via the North Pole.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hmmm. Perhaps a preferable stratagem might be to harry him amid-ships as he leaves the
			Mediterranean. Let's see - ahm, Trafalgar might be quite a good spot.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He points on the map.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			(<i>Rather taken aback</i>) Trafalgar? Well, I'll mention it to Nelson. I must say I'm
			beginning to regret the necessity of killing you, your Highness. I'd been told by everybody
			that the prince was a confounded moron.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, no, no, no.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Prince George whistling. He puts the tea tray down on the map.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Hell and buckshot! It's that tiresome servant again!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George sits down next to Blackadder casually.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ooh, budge up, budge up!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			How dare you sit in the presence of your betters!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, cripes, yes, I forgot.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Wellington really smacks him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			You speak when you're spoken to and not before, sir! Or perhaps you'd prefer to be flayed
			across a gun carriage. Well!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hits him again. Prince George can scarcely believe it. He comes and stands next to
			Blackadder, hoping for protection.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, I fear you have been too long a soldier. We no longer treat servants that way in
			London society.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Why, I hardly touched the man!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I fear that you hit him very hard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Nonsense - that would have been a hard hit.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hits Prince George hard.</i><br />
			<br />
			I just hit him like this.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hits him again, quite hard actually.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, sir. A soft hit would be like this (<i>soft hit</i>), and you hit him like this
			(<i>very, very hard hit</i>).<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George falls over, and picks himself up again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I wonder if I might be excused, your Highness, your Highness?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, certainly. (<i>He whispers to Prince George</i>) Sorry about that, sir, but one has
			to keep up the pretence.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			(<i>Whispering</i>) Of course, quite understand, keep up the good work.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Very good, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder punches him on the nose. Prince George tries to leave.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Hang on, this is bloody coffee, I ordered tea.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hauls Prince George back from the doorway by the ear.</i><br />
			<br />
			You really are a most confounded fool. I had heard everywhere that the prince was the
			imbecile but his servant Blackadder was respected about the town. Now I discover the
			truth, I am disposed to beat you to death ... Tea!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George picks up the tray and scuttles out, almost crying. Wellington kicks his
			retreating backside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Tell me, do you ever stop bullying and shouting at the lower orders?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			(<i>Bellowing</i>) Never! There's only one way to run a campaign - shout, shout and
			shout again!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You don't think then that inspired leadership and tactical ability has anything to do
			with it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			No, it's all down to shouting! Baaah!<br />
			<br />
			<i>A mighty roar!</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I hear that conditions in your army are appalling.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Well, I'm sorry but those are my conditions and you'll just have to accept them. At least
			until this evening, when I shall kill you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Who knows, maybe I'll kill you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Nonsense! I have never been so much as scratched - my skin is as smooth as a baby's bottom.
			Which is more than you can say for my bottom.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Just one point, sir. I should perhaps warn you that while duelling, I tend to put on my
			lucky wig and regimental accent.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Well, that won't help you. It would take a homicidal maniac in a claymore and a kilt to
			get the better of me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, that's handy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George is behaving like a temperamental diva.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I tell you, Baldrick, I'm not leaving the kitchen until that man is out of the house.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A knock at the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			All right, your Majesty. Don't worry. I'll deal with this.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Mrs Miggins.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Hello, Baldrick, I've brought your buns. Where's Mr Blackadder? Not upstairs again,
			running about for that port-swilling, tadpole-brained smelly boots?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George slides out of sight behind the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I don't know who you mean.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Prince George, Baldrick. His boots smell so bad a man would need to have his nose
			amputated before taking them off. That's what Mr Blackadder says.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			(<i>Very worried</i>) As a joke.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Didn't you write a little poem about him last week?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, I didn't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oh, you did. In the winter it's cool, In the summer it's hot, But all the year round,
			Prince George is a clot.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Prince George is a lovely. I said Prince George is a lovely.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Well, I'd better be off. Tell Mr Blackadder to expect that Mr MacAdder at five o'clock.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She gets ready to leave.</i><br />
			<br />
			As soon as that fat Prussian truffle pig's got his snout wedged into a bucket of tea
			cakes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She makes a snorting noise and leaves.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I think it must be next door you're wanting, Strange-Woman-Who-I've-Never-Seen-Before,
			Mrs Miggins.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The prince reappears.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Baldrick!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Your Highness?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			(<i>Very moved</i>) Is it true? Did you really write a poem about how lovely I am?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes. And Mr Blackadder loves you too.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, I must say I find that very touching.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The bell goes. Prince George jumps to it. I wish they wouldn't go on doing that.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Wellington and Blackadder are standing by the door. Wellington shakes Blackadder's
			hand.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Goodbye, sir. May the best man win, sir, i.e. me.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Prince George with tea tray.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Your tea, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			You're late! Where have you been for it - India?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He slaps Prince George.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Or Ceylon?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He also slaps Prince George.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Or China?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He kicks Prince George, who crashes into the table with his tray.</i><br />
			<br />
			Don't bother to show me out, I don't want to die of old age before I reach the front door.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he exits. It's not been a good day for the prince.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: MRS MIGGINS'S COFFEE SHOP</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, Miggins, where's MacAdder? I thought he was going to be here at five o'clock?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Yes, I'm sorry - he's just popped out. You look ever so similar to each other, you know.
			It's quite eerie.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Look, did you tell him to be here or not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			I did, I did! You just seem to keep missing each other - I can't imagine why.<br />
			<br />
			<i>MacAdder appears at the door - red-haired, wild and kilted. They really are astonishingly
			similar. If it wasn't physically impossible, a person would swear they were the same
			person in slightly different wigs - one of whom is putting on a rather unconvincing
			Scottish accent.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>MacAdder</b><br />
			I'll tell you why - it's because no coffee shop in England is big enough for two Blackadders.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah - good day cousin MacAdder. I trust you are well.<br />
			<br />
			<b>MacAdder</b><br />
			Aye, well enough.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And dear Morag?<br />
			<br />
			<b>MacAdder</b><br />
			She bides fine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And how stands that mighty army, the Clan MacAdder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>MacAdder</b><br />
			They're both well.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I've always thought Jamie and Angus were such fine boys.<br />
			<br />
			<b>MacAdder</b><br />
			Angus is a girl.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course.<br />
			<br />
			<b>MacAdder</b><br />
			So tell me, cousin, I hear you have a cunning plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I do, I do. I want you to take the place of the Prince Regent and kill the Duke of Wellington
			in a duel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>MacAdder</b><br />
			Aye, and what's in it for me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Enough cash to buy the Outer Hebrides. What do you think?<br />
			<br />
			<b>MacAdder</b><br />
			Fourteen shillings and six pence? Well, it's tempting but I've got a better plan. Why don't
			I pretend to be the Duke of Wellington and kill the Prince of Wales in a duel? Then I shall
			be the king and be crowned with the ancient stone bonnet of MacAdder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			(<i>Clasping MacAdder's arm</i>) And I shall wear the granite gown and limestone bodice of
			MacMiggins. Queen of all the Herds.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, for God's sake, MacAdder, you're not Rob Roy. You're a top kipper salesman with a
			reputable firm of Aberdeen fishmongers. Don't throw it all away. If you kill the prince,
			they'll just send the bailiffs round to arrest you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>MacAdder</b><br />
			Oh, blast. I forgot the bailiffs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So we can return to our original plan then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>MacAdder</b><br />
			No, I'm not interested. I'd sooner go to bed with the Loch Lomond Monster and, besides,
			I have to be back in the office on Friday - I promised Mr McNulty I'd shift a particularly
			difficult bloater for him. Forget the whole thing - I'm off home with Miggsie.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Yes, yes, show me the glen where the kipper roams free. Forget Morag for ever.<br />
			<br />
			<b>MaeAdder</b><br />
			Never. We must do right by Morag. We must return to Scotland and you shall have to fight
			her for me in the old Highland way ... bare - breasted and each carrying an eight - pound
			baby.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			I shall do it. I love babies.<br />
			<br />
			<b>MacAdder</b><br />
			You are a woman of spirit. I look forward to burying you in the old Highland manner.
			Blackadder - farewell, you spineless goon.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And they are gone.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God. Fortune vomits on my eider-down once more.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Blackadder. The prince is deep in thought.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah, Blackadder. It has been a wild afternoon full of strange omens. I dreamt that a
			large eagle circled the room three times and then got into bed with me and took all
			the blankets. And then I saw that it wasn't an eagle but a large black snake. Also,
			Duncan's horses did turn and eat each other - as usual. Good portents for your duel,
			do you think?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not very good, sir. I'm afraid the duel is off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Off?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			As in 'sod'. I'm not doing it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			By thunder, here's a pretty game! You will stay, sir, and do duty by your prince, or ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Suddenly annoyed</i>) Or what, you port-brained twerp? I've looked after you all
			my life. Even when we were babies I had to show you which bit of your mother was serving
			the drinks.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			(<i>Falling to his knees</i>) Oh please, please, please, you've got to help me! I don't
			want to die! I've got so much to give. I want more time!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A poignant plea, sir, enough to melt the stoniest of hearts, but the answer, I'm afraid,
			must remain 'You're going to die, fat pig.'<br />
			<br />
			<i>He goes to the door. Prince George leaps to his feet.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Wait, wait, wait! I'll give you everything!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Everything?<br />
			<br />
			<i>This does rather stop Blackadder in his tracks. He shuts the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Everything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The money, the castles, the jewellery?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The highly artistic but also highly illegal set of French lithographs?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Everything!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The amusing clock where the little man comes out and drops his trousers every half hour?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, yes, yes! All right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right, I accept. A man may fight for many things, his country, his friends, his
			principles, the glistening tear on the cheek of a golden child. But personally, I'd
			mud-wrestle my own mother for a ton of cash, an amusing clock and a sack of French porn.
			You're on.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWELVE: A COLONNADE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder, still wearing the prince's wig and coat, and Baldrick are first to arrive
			for the duel. It is a misty morning, the kind of weather in which momentous deeds are
			done.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, Baldrick, here's the plan. When he offers me the swords, I kick him in the nuts
			and you set fire to the building. In the confusion we claim a draw. All right?<br />
			<br />
			<i>At which moment the Duke of Wellington enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Your Highness. (<i>Bows to Blackadder</i>) Let us be about our business.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder takes Baldrick aside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't forget, Balders, you ... (<i>mimes lighting a match</i>) when I ... (<i>mimes knee jerk</i>)<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Then, sir, choose your stoker.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He holds out a box. Blackadder takes out one of the furry plungers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What! Are we going to tickle each other to death?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			No, sir. We fight with cannon!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder notices two small cannon at each end of the half-assembled colonnade.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But I thought we were fighting with swords?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Swords! What do you think this is, the Middle Ages? Only girls fight with swords these days. Stand by your gun, sir. Hup two three, hup two three hup!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Wait a minute.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Stand by cannon for loading procedure!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shouts out bewildering technical lingo with movements like the Royal Tournament and with bits of metal snapping into place.</i><br />
			<br />
			Muzzle! Stoke! Crank the staunch pedal! Ready priming paper! Pull tinder!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is not keeping up at all. He reads from the cannon's manual.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			'Congratulations on choosing the Armstrong Whitworth four-pounder cannonette. Please read instructions carefully and it should give you years of trouble-free maiming.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Check elevation! Chart trajectory!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder doesn't know where to start. Meantime, Wellington is kneeling by a perfect little cannon, pointed at Blackadder, three feet away. He lights it with a taper at arm's length.</i><br />
			<br />
			Prime fuse! Aim!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now look, just wait a moment.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Fire!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Huge cannon shot, Blackadder is blown over. When the smoke clears he lies with his head in Baldrick's lap, distinctly dying. Sad music wafts through the still air.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Mr B, oh, Mr B! (<i>Calling out</i>) Help me get his coat off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Leave it, Baldrick, it doesn't matter.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It does, sir, blood's hell to shift. I want to get it in to soak.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Wellington kneels on one knee beside the heroic and doomed figure.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			You die like a man, sir, in combat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You think so? Dammit, we must build a better world. When will the killing end?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			You don't think that I too dream of peace? You don't think that I despise this damn dirty
			job they call soldiering?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Frankly, no. My final wish upon this earth is that Baldrick he sold to provide funds for
			a Blackadder foundation to promote peace and do research into the possibility of an
			automatic machine for cleaning shoes. Also, I charge that ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He dies. Woe upon woe.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			His Highness is dead.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The music jerks to a sudden stop.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Actually, I'm not sure I am ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Miracle upon miracle, he springs to his feet.</i><br />
			<br />
			Fortunately that cigarillo box you gave me was placed exactly at the point the cannon
			ball struck. I've always said smoking was good for you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Wellington rises.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			Honour is satisfied. God clearly preserves you for greatness. His Highness is saved.
			Hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he drops to one knee again. At which point, Prince George enters, in Blackadder's
			wig and coat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Umm no, actually, it's me. I'm his Highness. Well done Bladders. Glad you made it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Wellington is red with fury.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			What in the name of a Bonaparte's balls is this fellow about now?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			No, I really am the prince. It was all just larks, and uncommon fine larks at that, I
			thought.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			I have never, in all my campaigns, encountered such insolence! Your master survives a
			duel of honour and you cheek him like a French whoopsy. I can contain myself no longer.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shoots Prince George cursorily. Sad music starts up again. Prince George lies in
			the laps of Blackadder and Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I die. I hope men will say of me that I did duty by my country.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm thinking that's pretty unlikely, sir. If I were you I'd try something a bit more
			realistic.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Like what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Uhm, you hope that men will think of you as a bit of a thicky.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			All right, I'll hope that. Toodle-oo, don't ye know, and all that.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George dies.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a fanfare of trumpets, and a shout, 'Kneel for his Majesty, the King of
			England. Enter the king, a big mad German carrying a plant. They all kneel.</i><br />
			 <br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Someone said my son was here. I want him to marry this rosebush, and want to make the
			wedding arrangements.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A short meaningful pause.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Here I am, Daddy. This is the Iron Duke Wellington, commander of all your Majesty's
			armed forces.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Yes, I recognize the enormous conk.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Wellington puts his arm around Blackadder as they face the king. He is very complimentary
			of Blackadder, who laps it up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			A hero. A man of taste and wit and discretion.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Well, bravo! You know, son, for the first time in my life, I have a real fatherly feeling
			about you. I know people think I'm stark raving mad, and say the word 'Penguin' at the
			end of every sentence, but I believe we too can make Britain great - with you as prince
			regent and I as King Penguin.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Let's hope, eh? My Lord Wellington ... will you come and dine with us at the palace? My
			family have a lot to thank you for.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wellington</b><br />
			With pleasure. Your father may be as mad as a balloon but you have the makings of a
			fine king.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, and Baldrick, clear away that dead butler, will you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They leave. Baldrick is left alone with Prince George. He kneels beside him, full
			of sorrow.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			A new star in heaven tonight, a new freckle on the nose of the giant pixie.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George suddenly opens his eyes and sits up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			No, actually, Baldrick, I'm not dead! You see, I had a cigarillo box too!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He searches for it in his pocket, but to no avail.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh damn, I must have left it on the dresser.<br />
