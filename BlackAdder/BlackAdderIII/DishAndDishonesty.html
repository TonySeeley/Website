			<b>SCENE ONE: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The kitchen in the basement of the home of George, Prince Regent. As the prince's chambers are
			glorious and drenched in sun, so are these clingy and caked in dirt. A fit home for Baldrick - a
			squalid necessity for Blackadder, the butler. Baldrick is cleaning Blackadder's shoes. Mrs Miggins
			has delivered some groceries.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, Mrs Miggins, at last we can return to sanity - the hustings are over, the hunting is down,
			the mad hysteria is at an end. After the chaos of a general election, we can return to normal.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Has there been a general election then, Mr Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Indeed there has, Mrs Miggins.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Well, I never heard about it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course you didn't. You're not eligible to vote.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Why not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Because virtually no one is - women, peasants, chimpanzees, lunatics, lords.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, that's not true. Lord Nelson's got a vote.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			He's got a <i>boat</i>, Baldrick. Marvellous thing democracy. Look at Manchester - population
			60,000, electoral roll, three.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Well, I may have a brain the size of a sultana...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Correct.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			But it hardly seems fair to me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course it's not fair. And a good thing too. Give the likes of Baldrick the vote and we'll be
			back to cavorting Druids, death by stoning and dung for dinner.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, I'm having dung for dinner tonight.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			So who are they electing when they have these elections?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh ... the same old shower. Fat Tory landowners who get made MPs when they reach a certain weight.
			Raving revolutionaries who think that just because they do a day's work that somehow gives them
			the right to get paid. So basically it's a nice old mess. Toffs at the top, plebs at the bottom
			and me in the middle making a fat pile of cash out of both of them.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			You better watch out, Mr Blackadder. Things are bound to change.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not while Pitt the Elder's Prime Minister. He's about as effective as a cat flap in an elephant
			house. And as long as his feet are warm and he gets a nice cup of milky tea in the sun before his
			morning nap, he doesn't bother anyone till his potty needs emptying.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE HOUSE OF COMMONS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Three fat men are sitting against a panelled wall.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Speaker</b><br />
			Honourable Members of the House of Commons. I call upon the new Prime Minister of Great Britain
			and her empires, Mr William Pitt. The Younger.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A sprightly but very suave fifteen-year-old schoolboy stands up from behind the fat men. It is
			Pitt the Younger.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			Mr Speaker and Members of the House, I shall be brief as I have rather unfortunately become Prime
			Minister right in the middle of my exams.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mixture of cheers and boos.</i><br />
			<br />
			I look forward to fulfilling my duty in a manner of which Nanny would be proud. I shall introduce
			legislation to utterly destroy three enemies of the state. The first is that evil dictator,
			Napoleon Bonaparte.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Hum of approval.</i><br />
			<br />
			The second is my old geography master, Banana-breath Scrigshanks.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Another hum.</i><br />
			<br />
			But, most of all sirs, I intend to pursue that utter slob, the Prince of Wales.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Here, here!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			Why, this year alone he has spent £15,000 on banqueting.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Boo!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			Twenty thousand pounds on perfume.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Poo!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			And, most astonishingly of all, an astonishing £59,000 on socks.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Shame!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			Therefore my three main policy priorities are: One, war with France. Two, tougher sentences for
			geography teachers. Three, a right royal kick up the prince's backside.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			I now call upon the Leader of the Opposition to test me on my Latin vocab.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George is dressing. Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, if I may make so bold, a major crisis has arisen in your affairs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, I know Blackadder. I have been pondering it all morning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yon have, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, Blackadder. Socks. Run out again. Why is it that no matter how many millions of pairs of
			socks I buy, I never seem to have any?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, with your forgiveness, there is another, even weightier problem.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			They just disappear. Honestly, you'd think someone was coming in here stealing the damn things
			and selling them off.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder laughs calmly. For the first time in his life, the prince is actually right about
			something.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Impossible, sir. Only you and I have access to your socks.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, yes, you're right. Still, for me, socks are like sex. Tons of it about but I never seem
			to get any.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, if I may return to this very urgent matter. I read fearful news in this morning's paper.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, no! Not another little cat caught up in a tree?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No sir - there is a vote afoot in the new parliament to strike you from the civil list.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, yes, but what are they going to do about my socks?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, if this bill goes through, you won't have any socks.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, I haven't got any socks at the moment.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Or any trousers, shirts, waistcoats, or pantaloons. They're going to bankrupt you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			But they can't do that - the public love me. Why, only the other day I was out in the street,
			and they sang 'We hail Prince George! We hail Prince George!'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			'We hate Prince George', sire. 'We hate Prince George'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Was it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I fear so, sir. However, all is not lost. Fortunately the numbers in the Commons are exactly
			equal and if we can find one more MP to support us, you're safe.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Hurrah! Any ideas?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir. There is one man who might just be the ace up our sleeve. A rather crusty loudmouthed
			ace named Sir Talbot Buxomly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Never heard of him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's hardly surprising sir. Sir Talbot has the worst attendance record of any Member of
			Parliament. On the one occasion he did enter the House of Commons, he passed water in the Great
			Hall and then passed out in the Speaker's Chair. But if we can get him to support us, we're safe.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			What's he like?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, according to Who's Who, his interests include flogging servants, shooting poor people and
			the extension of slavery to anyone who hasn't got a knighthood.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Excellent. Sensible policies for a happier Britain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			However, if we are going to get him to support us, he will need some sort of incentive.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Hmmm. Anything in mind?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir - you could appoint him a High Court Judge.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Is he qualified?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			He's a violent, bigoted, mindless old fool.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Sounds a bit overqualified. Well, get him here at once!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Certainly, sir. I shall return before you can say 'antidisestablishmentarianism'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, I wouldn't be too sure. 'Antidisist' 'antidesi' ... 'antidisestis'<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder leaves.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Two days later.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			'Antidistinctly' ... 'minty' ... 'monetarism' ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Your Highness, Sir Talbot Buxomly, MP.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Sir Talbot Buxomly walks through the door. He is very red-cheeked and very over-fed and he
			wears red beagling gear.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah, Buxomly - roaringly splendid to have you here - how are you, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Talbot</b><br />
			Heartily well, your Highness. I dined hugely off a servant before coming to town.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			<i>(Nervous)</i> Uhm... you eat your servants?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Talbot</b><br />
			No, sir - I eat off them. Why should I spend good money on tables when I have men standing idle?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Why indeed? Now you have probably heard of Mr Pitt's intentions ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Talbot</b><br />
			<i>(Furious)</i> Young scallywag.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah, so you don't approve of his plans to abolish me then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Talbot</b><br />
			I do not sir! Damn his eyes! Damn his britches! Damn his duck pond!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Hurrah for that!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is pleased too.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Talbot</b><br />
			I mind not a jot if you are the son of a certified sauerkraut-sucking loon.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Thank you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Talbot</b><br />
			It minds not me that you dress like a mad parrot and talk like a plate of beans negotiating their
			way out of a cow's digestive system.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Good on you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Talbot</b><br />
			It is no skin off my rosy nose that there are bits of lemon peel floating down the Thames who
			would make better regents than you...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, bravo. <i>(Oblivious to all insults)</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Talbot</b><br />
			The fact is, you are the Regent. Appointed by God. And I will stick by you for ever, though
			infirmity lay me waste and ill-health curse my every waking moment.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He sits down firmly on a chair.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Good on you, sir - and don't talk to me about infirmity. Why, sir, you are the hardy stock that
			is the core of Britain's greatness. You have the physique of a demi-god, purple of cheek and
			plump of fetlock. The shapely ankle and the well-filled trouser that tells of a human body in
			perfect working order.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(Who is feeling Sir Talbot's pulse)</i> He's dead, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Dead?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, your Highness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			What bad luck - we were rather getting on.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We must move at once.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			In which direction?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			As you know, your Highness, Sir Talbot represented the constituency of Dunny-on-the-Wold. And
			by an extraordinary stroke of luck it is a rotten borough.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Really! Is it? Well, well. Lucky, lucky us. Yippee. Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky. Lucky lucky.
			Lucky. Luck-a-doodle-dandy-dingle. Luck lurrck. Lurrrck. Cluck, cluck, cluck. Lurrrrrck-cluck-
			cluck-cluck.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You don't know what a rotten borough is, do you, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So what was the chicken impression in aid of?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, I didn't want to hurt your feelings. So, what is a robber button?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Rotten borough.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, quite.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A rotten borough, sir, is a constituency where the owner of the land corruptly controls both
			the voters and the MP.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Good. Yes. And a robber button is...?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Can we leave that for a moment?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Right. Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Dunny-on-the-Wold is a tuppenny-ha'penny place. Half an acre of sodden marshland in the Suffolk
			fens, with an empty town hall in it. Population - three rather mangy cows, a dachshund named
			Cohn, and a small hen in its late forties.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			No people at all, apart from Colin?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Cohn is a dog, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Only one actual person lives there. He is the voter.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well right, so what's the plan?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We must buy Dunny-on-the-Wold at once, and thus control the voter. I shall need a thousand
			pounds.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			A thousand pounds? I thought you said it was a tuppenny-ha'penny place?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir. The land will cost tuppence ha'penny. But there are many other factors to be considered.
			Stamp duty, window tax, swamp insurance. Hen food, dog biscuits, cow ointment. The expenses
			are endless.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Fine, the money's in my desk.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, sir, it's in my wallet.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Splendid, no time to lose, eh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My own thoughts precisely, sir. The only question is who to choose as MP.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah - tricky.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What we need is an utter unknown, yet someone over whom we have complete power. A man with no
			mind, with no ideas of his own. One might almost say, a man with no brain.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He rings the bell.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Any thoughts?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, your Highness.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You rang, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Meet the new Member of Parliament for Dunny-on-the-Wold.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			But he's an absolute arsehead!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Precisely, sir. Our slogan shall be 'A rotten candidate for a rotten borough'. Baldrick, I want
			you to go back to your kitchen sink you see and prepare for government.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick and Blackadder at the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right now, all you have to do is fill in this MP application form. Name?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick </b><br />
			Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			First name?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Not sure.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You must have some idea.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well it might be Sod Off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			When I used to play in the gutter I used to say to the other snipes 'Hello, my name s Baldrick'
			and they used to say 'Yes, we know. Sod off, Baldrick.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right. Mr S. Baldrick. Now, distinguishing features? <i>(He thinks it through)</i> None.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, I've got this big growth in the middle of my face here...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's your nose, Baldrick. 'Any history of insanity in family?' Hmm... tell you what, I'll cross
			out the 'in' ... <i>(Reads)</i> 'Any history of sanity in the family?' <i>(Writes)</i> 'None
			whatsoever'. Now then, 'Criminal record?'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			<i>(Proudly)</i> Absolutely not.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, you're going to be an MP, for God's sake. I'll put 'fraud, and sexual deviancy' ... and
			finally, 'Minimum bribe level'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			One turnip. Oh hang on, I don't want to price myself out of the market.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, I've always been meaning to ask. Do you have any ambitions in life apart from the
			acquisition of turnips?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So what would you do if I gave you a thousand pounds?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oooh. I'd get a little turnip of my own.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what would you do if I gave you a million pounds?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh well, that's different. I'd get a great big turnip in the country.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Violent knocking on the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God. I'll get that. Just sign here.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He holds out the form to Baldrick, who puts a cross on Blackadder's hand. Blackadder sighs and
			stamps the paper with his hand.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The Prince is loitering, when Blackadder enters with Pitt.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Your Highness. Pitt the Younger.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Why, hullo there, young shaver me lad. I say, here's fun, I've a shiny sixpence here for the clever
			fellow who can tell me which hand it's in, ha, ha!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He holds out his hands. Pitt the Younger stares impassively at him.</i><br />
			<br />
			Ah. School, school. Half hols, is it? Bet you can't wait to get your bat in your hand and give
			those halls a good wallop-ping.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mr Pitt is the Prime Minister, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Go on! Is he? What, young snotty here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			I'd rather have a runny nose than a runny brain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Eh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Uhm, excuse me, Prime Minister, we do have some lovely jelly in the pantry. I don't know if you'd
			be interested?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			Don't patronize me, you lower-middle-class yobbo! What flavour is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Blackcurrant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			Eeeuughhh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I say, Blackadder, are you sure this is the PM? He seems like a bit of an oily tick to me. When
			I was at school, we used to line up four or five of his sort, tell 'em to bend over and use them
			as a toast rack.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			It doesn't surprise me, sir. I know your sort. Once it was I who stood in the big cold school
			room, a hot crumpet burning my cheeks with shame. Since that day I have been busy every hour God
			sent working to become Prime Minister and fight sloth and privilege wherever I find it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I trust you weren't too busy to remove the crumpet.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			You will regret this, gentlemen. You think you can thwart my plans to bankrupt the prince by fixing
			the Dunny-on-the-Wold by-election. But you will be thrashed. I intend to put up my own brother as
			a candidate against you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And which Pitt would this be? Pitt the Toddler? Pitt the Embryo? Pitt the Glint in the Milkman's
			Eye?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			Ha, sirs. As I said to Chancellor Metternich at the Congress of Strasburg, 'Poo to you with nobs
			on!' We shall meet, sirs, on the hustings.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He exits with bravado.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I say, Blackadder, what a ghastly squit! He's not going to win, is he?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No sir, because, firstly, we shall fight this campaign on issues and not personalities. Secondly,
			we will be the only fresh thing on the menu. And thirdly, of course, we'll cheat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: PARISH HALL, DUNNY-ON-THEWOLD</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is election night. The small hall has been done up with a few flags and things. A tiny stage
			is at the end with chairs.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Mr Vincent Hanna, the Town Crier, is reporting on events.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Good evening and welcome to the Dunny-on-the-Wold by-election. The first thing I must tell you is
			that the turnout has been very good. As a matter of fact, the voter turned out before breakfast.
			And I can now bring you the result of our exclusive exit poll which produced a 100 per cent result
			for <i>(rustles papers)</i> ... 'Mind your own business, you nosy bastard'.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A journalist outside calls up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Journalist</b><br />
			Mr Hanna, are you going to talk to any of the candidates?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			I certainly am. And I can see Prince George now, who is leader of what has come to be known as
			the Adder Party. Prince George, who has been described in his party news-sheet as a great moral
			and spiritual leader of the nation, but is described by almost everyone else as a fat, flatulent
			git. Prince George, hullo.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George appears next to Hanna holding a dachshund.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Good evening.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			And good evening, Colin. Tell me, how do you see your prospects in this election?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, first - I'd like a word about the disgraceful circumstances in which this election arose.
			We paid for this seat - I think it's a damn liberty that we have to stand for it as well. And
			another thing, why is it that no matter how many pairs of socks a man buys, he never seems to
			have enough?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Well, fighting words from the Prince Regent. <i>(Prince George leaves, satisfied at a job well
			done)</i> And now, let's have a word with the Adder Party candidate, Mr S. Baldrick, who so far
			has not commented on his policies in this campaign. But with him is his election agent, Mr E.
			Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick appears with a turnip in his mouth. Blackadder is next to him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We in the Adder Party are determined to fight this election on issues, not personality.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Why is that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Because our candidate doesn't have a personality.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Well, he hasn't said much about the issues either.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			He's got something wrong with his throat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Well, perhaps he could answer one question at least. What does the 'S' in his name stand for?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sod off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Fair enough - none of my business really. And now it's time for a result. The tension is very
			high here. Mr Blackadder assures me that this will be the first honest vote ever in a rotten
			borough and I think we all hope for a result which reflects the real needs of the constituency.
			And behind me - yes - I think I can see the acting returning officer coming to the front of the
			platform.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is on the platform with Prince George, Pitt the Younger, Pitt the Even Younger with
			his mother Mrs Pitt, an angry-looking boringly dressed man and a fellow in very silly clothes -
			Ivor Biggun. And Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			As acting returning officer for Dunny-on-the-Wold...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Hanna comments on the proceedings with quiet discretion.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			The acting returning officer of course, Mr E. Blackadder, and we're all very grateful that he's
			stepped in at the last minute when the previous returning officer accidentally brutally stabbed
			himself in the stomach while shaving.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I now announce the number of votes cast as follows. Brigadier General Horace Balsam...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Keep Royalty White, Rat Catching and Safe Sewage Residents' Party.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No votes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The angry-looking man stomps off.</i><br />
			<br />
			Ivor 'Jest ye not madam' Biggun.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Standing at the Back Dressed Stupidly and Looking Stupid Party.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No votes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Silly-dressed man blows a kazoo and laughs. No one else does.</i><br />
			<br />
			Sad. Pitt the Even Younger.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Whig.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No votes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Oh, there's a shock!!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mr S. Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Adder Party.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			16,472.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A cheer.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			And there we have it - victory for the Adder Party, a sensational swing against the Whigs. I'll
			just try and get a final word with some of the candidates as they come up from the stage. Master
			William Pitt the Even Younger, are you disappointed?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Pitt the Even Younger is eight years old.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt the Even Younger</b><br />
			Yes, I'm horrified. I smeared my opponent, bribed the press to be on my side, and threatened to
			torture the electorate if we lost. I fail to see what more a decent politician could have done.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Well, quite. And now, Mr Ivor Biggun. No votes at all for the Standing at the Back Dressed
			Stupidly and Looking Stupid Party. Are you disappointed?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Biggun</b><br />
			No, not really, no. I always say, if you can't laugh, what can you do?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He squirts Hanna with his flower.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Take up politics perhaps. Has your party got any policies?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Biggun</b><br />
			Yes, we're for the compulsory serving of asparagus at breakfast, free corsets for the under-fives
			and the abolition of slavery.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Obviously many moderate people would respect your stand on asparagus, but what about this
			extremist nonsense about abolishing slavery?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Biggun</b><br />
			Oh, we just put that in for a joke - see you next year.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			And now finally, a word with the man who is at the centre of this by-election mystery: the voter
			himself. <i>(Consults piece of paper)</i> And his name is Mr E. Blackadder <i>(for it is he)</i>
			Mr Blackadder, you are the only voter in this rotten borough.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's right, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			How long have you lived in this constituency?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Since Wednesday morning. I took over from the original electorate after he very sadly accidentally
			brutally cut his head off while combing his hair.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			One voter - 16,472 votes. A slight anomaly?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not really, Mr Hanna. You see, Mr Baldrick may look like a monkey who's been put in a suit and
			then strategically shaved, hut he's a brilliant politician. The number of votes I cast is simply
			a reflection of how firmly I believe in his policies.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hanna</b><br />
			Well, that's excellent. And, that's all from me - another great day for democracy in our country.
			Vincent Hanna, <i> Country Gentleman's Pig and Fertilizer Gazette</i>, Dunny-on-the-Wold.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is in very high spirits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We are reprieved. It is a triumph for stupidity over common sense.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Thank you very much.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			As a special reward, Baldrick, take a short holiday. <i>(He does not pause at all)</i> Did you
			enjoy it? Right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: THE HOUSE OF COMMONS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The three fat men again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Speaker</b><br />
			Will the Honourable Members please cast their votes, Aye or Nay, for the striking of the Prince
			Regent off the civil lists?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The fat men go off to vote, leaving Baldrick all alone.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Excuse me. Excuse me?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Pitt pops up from behind the bench.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			Hello, little chappie - are you the new bug?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes - I don't know anyone here and I support the prince and I don't know how to vote.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			Ah! We can soon change all that, can't we? Come along with me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			<i>(Big smile)</i> Oh, thanks.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: PRINCE GEORGE'S FRONT DOOR</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder opens it to Pitt.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, well, well, if it isn't the Lord Privy toast rack. Pull up a muffin and sit yourself down.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			You don't like me, do you, Mr Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, nobody likes a loser.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			Oh, then that must be why nobody likes you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			You lost the vote. Your monkey obligingly voted for us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God. If you want something done properly, kill Baldrick before you start.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			You're beaten, oik, and you and your disgusting master have twenty-four hours to get out.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Twenty-four hours is a long time in polities. Good day.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pitt</b><br />
			There's just one thing before I go. I've got this sort of downy hair developing on my chest, is
			that normal? Also, I get so lonely and confused. I've written a poem about it, maybe you'll
			understand... 'Why do nice girls hate me? Why do ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh get out, you nauseating adolescent.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He slams the door on the pimply youth.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is on a spit above the oven. Mrs Miggins has dropped by for the roasting.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			How could I have been so stupid? Goodbye Millionaire's Row, hullo Room 12 of the Budleigh
			Salterton Twilight Rest Home for the Terminally Short of Cash.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oooh, er! And to think you once dreamed you'd end up in the House of Lords.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			The House of Lords.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course, the House of Lords! I'd forgotten the House of Lords. They'll never let the bill
			through. Every man jack of them will be behind the prince.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Hurrah!!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right! Take Baldrick off the spit.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I have a plan so cunning you put a tail on it and call it a weasel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWELVE: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George is looking through a telescope. Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Tally-ho, Blackadder! You look happy as a man who thought a cat had done its business on his
			pie but it turned out to be an extra big blackberry. Did our plan go well?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Excellently, sir. Order a thousand pairs of the finest cotton socks. Take out the drawings for
			that beach-hut at Brighton.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			There, was, however, one slight <i>(cough)</i> hiccup.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Cough, I think you mean.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, sir - hiccup. The motion about your impoverishment has now moved on to the
			House of Lords.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, bravo. No worry there then, every man jack of them will be behind me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(Very grave)</i> Ah, would that were so, your Highness. These are treacherous times.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Are they?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. It might be wise to appoint a new lord to make sure the old lords vote the right way.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Good thinking. A new lord. Any idea who?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, sire - one name does leap to mind.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Does it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George thinks for a moment. They stare at each other.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ahm ... you couldn't make it leap any higher, could you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A young man in your service, sir - who has done sterling work, matching the political
			machinations of the evil Pitt.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He gently points to his waistcoat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Aha - of course, Blackadder! How can I thank you enough?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And it might be wise to bribe a few lords, just to make sure they vote the way their
			consciences tell them.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oooh - how many should we bribe?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think 300 to be sure. At £1,000 each.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Three hundred thousand pounds!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Four hundred thousand, I think you'll find, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George thinks hard.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, you're right. Thank God I've got you to advise me, Bladder. Just remind me, what do I
			have to do to appoint this lord chappie?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Very simple, sire. You put on your robes of state, he puts on his, then you sign the document
			of ennoblement and despatch him at once to the House of Lords.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Excellent - I shall change immediately. <br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And so, sir, shall I.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THIRTEEN: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters in an ermine gown.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>Voilà</i>, Mrs Miggins, my robes of state. A thousand pounds well spent, I think.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oh, very nice! And it's real cat, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			This is not cat, Mrs Miggins. It is finest leather-trimmed ermine with gold medallion accessories.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oh, go on, Mr Blackadder, it's cat. Oh, they've left the little collars on!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(Reads medallion)</i> 'Mr Friskie. If found please return to Emma Hamilton, Marine Parade,
			Portsmouth'. Damn! Oh, well. Who cares about a dead cat now that I'm a fat cat?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oh, you're full of yourself today, Mr B!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Which is more than can be said for Mr Friskie.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOURTEEN: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder sweeps in, in full lordly regalia.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			My lords.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Pardon, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, lords. There is more than one lord in the vicinity. Will you please welcome his
			Grace, Lord Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters in his lordly regalia.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You've made Baldrick a lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, yes. One 'who has recently done sterling service, matching the political machinations
			of the evil Pitt'. Good old Lord Baldrick!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It's all right, Blackadder. You don't have to curtsey or anything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, might I let loose a short, violent exclamation?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Certainly.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder moves discreetly sideways, then...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(Shouts)</i> DAMN!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George and Baldrick both jump.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I say, that's a hit of a strange get-up, isn't it, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, sir, I'm just off to a fancy dress party. I'm going as Lady Hamilton's pussy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He walks towards the door, stops and turns.</i><br />
			<br />
			There is one little question, sir. About the £400,000 to influence the lords...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah, yes. I gave that to Lord Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ahh! <i>(Big smile)</i> Sir, might I be permitted to take Lord Baldrick downstairs to give
			him some instruction in his lordly duties?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I think that's a splendid idea.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(To Baldrick)</i> This way - my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIFTEEN: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder pushes Baldrick in and slams his head on the kitchen table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Give me the bloody money, Baldrick, or you're dead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Give me the bloody money, Baldrick, or you're dead, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Just do it, Baldrick, or I shall further ennoble you by knighting you very clumsily with
			this meat cleaver.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I haven't got it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I Spent it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You spent it? What could you possibly spend £400,000 on?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick looks at a massive turnip on the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, no... oh, God, don't tell me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My dream turnip.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, how did you manage to find a turnip that cost £400,000?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, I had to haggle.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder slams the turnip over Baldrick's head. It stays there.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			This is the worst moment of my entire life. I've spent my last penny on a cat-skin windcheater,
			I've just broken a priceless turnip ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a knock at the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			And now I'm about to be viciously slaughtered by a naked Tunisian sock merchant. Well, all I
			can say, Baldrick, is that's the last time I dabble in politics.
