			<b>SCENE ONE: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George is in bed asleep. Blackadder attends. Prince George wakes violently.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh! Oh! Blackadder! Blackadder!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Your Highness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			What time is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Three o'clock in the afternoon, your Highness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh thank God for that. I thought I'd over-slept.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I trust you had a pleasant evening, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, no, actually. The most extraordinary thing happened. Last night, I was having a little snack
			at the Naughty Hell Fire Club and some fellow said I had the wit and sophistication of a donkey.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			An absurd suggestion, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			You're right, it is absurd.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Unless of course it was a particularly stupid donkey.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			You see, if only I'd thought of saying that.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It is often the way, sir. Too late one thinks of what one should have said. Sir Thomas More, for
			instance, burned alive for refusing to recant his Catholicism, must have been kicking himself as
			the flames licked higher, that it never occurred to him to say 'I recant my Catholicism'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, quite. Why, only the other day Prime Minister Pitt called me an idle scrounger. It wasn't
			until ages later that I thought how clever it would have been to have said, 'Oh bugger off, you
			old fart!' I need to improve my mind, Blackadder. I want people to say, 'That George, why he's as
			clever as a stick in a bucket of pig swill'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And how do you suggest this miracle is to be achieved, your Highness?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Easy. I shall become best friends with the cleverest man in England. That renowned brainbox Dr
			Samuel Johnson has asked me to he patron of his new book, and I intend to accept.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Would this be the long-awaited dictionary, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Who cares about the title, as long as there's plenty of juicy murders in it? I hear it's a
			masterpiece.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, sir, it is not. It's the most pointless book since How to Learn French was translated into
			French.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			You haven't got anything personal against Johnson, have you, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good lord, sir, not at all. In fact, I'd never heard of him till you mentioned him just now.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			But you do think he's a genius?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, sir, I do not. Unless, of course, the definition of genius in his ridiculous dictionary is
			'a fat dullard or wobble-bottom; a pompous ass with sweaty dewflaps'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ha! Close shave there, then! Lucky you warned me. I was about to embrace this unholy arse to the
			royal bosom.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I am delighted to have been instrumental in keeping your bosom free of arses.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Bravo!! I mustn't waste my time with wobble-bottoms. Now fetch some tea, will you, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder sets off.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Certainly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh and make it two cups, will you? That splendid brainbox Dr Johnson's coming round.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder cannot believe the prince's stupidity.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters, slamming the door behind him. He walks down the stairs.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Aagh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Something wrong, Mr B?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder reaches the bottom of the stairs and casually throws the prince 's tea-tray and its
			expensive, ceramic contents into an upturned barrel.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Something is always wrong, Balders. The fact that I am not a millionaire aristocrat with the sexual
			capacity of a rutting rhino is a constant niggle. But today something is even wronger. That
			globulous fraud Dr Johnson is coming to tea.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I thought he was the cleverest gentleman in England.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, I'd bump into cleverer people at a lodge meeting of the Guild of Village Idiots.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That's not what you said when you sent him your navel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Novel, Baldrick, not navel. I sent him my novel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Novel or navel, it sounds a bit like a bag of grapefruits to me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Bitterly</i>) The phrase, Baldrick, is a case of sour grapes and yes, it bloody well is.
			I mean, he might at least have written back, but no, nothing, not even a 'Dear Gertrude Perkins,
			thank you for your book. Get stuffed, Samuel Johnson.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Gertrude Perkins?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, I gave myself a female pseudonym. Everybody's doing it these days. Mrs Radcliffe, Jane Austen...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Jane Austen is a man?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course. A huge Yorkshireman with a beard like a rhododendron bush.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Quite a small one then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Compared to Dorothy Wordsworth's, certainly. James Boswell is the only real woman writing at the
			moment and that's just because she wants to get inside Johnson's britches.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Perhaps your book really isn't any good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, codswallop! It's taken me seven years and it's perfect: Edmund, a Butler's Tale. 'A giant
			roller-coaster of a novel in 400 sizzling chapters. A seering indictment of domestic servitude
			in the eighteenth century with some hot gypsies thrown in.' It's my magnum opus, Baldrick. Everybody
			has one novel in them and this is mine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, and this is mine.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He produces a single scruffy piece of paper.</i><br />
			<br />
			My magnificent octopus.<br />
			<br />
			<i>With a flourish he hands it to Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			This is your novel?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I can't stand long books.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Reading it</i>) 'Once upon a time there was a lovely little sausage called Baldrick, and it
			lived happily ever after.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It's semi-autobiographical.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And it's completely utterly awful. Dr Johnson will probably love it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The bell rings.</i><br />
			<br />
			Well, speak of the devil. I'd better go and make the great Doctor (<i>with sarcastic relish</i>)
			... comfortable. Let's see just how damn smart Dr Fatty Know-It-All really is. Oh, and prepare a
			fire for the prince, will you, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What should I use?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, any old rubbish will do. Paper's quite good. Here. (<i>He screws up Baldrick's novel and
			flicks it at him</i>) Try this for a start.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a knock at the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Enter!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder opens the door for Dr Johnson. He is sixty, fat and pompous.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Dr Johnson, your Highness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah, Dr Johnson. Damn cold day.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Indeed it is, sir. But a very fine one for I celebrated last night the encyclopaedic implementation
			of my premeditated orchestration of demotic Anglo-Saxon.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The prince nods sagely for a good while, then...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			No. Didn't catch any of that.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			I simply observed, sir, that I am felicitous, since during the course of the penultimate solar
			sojourn, I terminated my uninterrupted categorization of the vocabulary of our post-Norman tongue.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Don't know what you're talking about but it sounds damn saucy, you lucky thing! I know some fairly
			liberal-minded girls but I've never penultimated them in the solar sojourn or, for that matter,
			been given any Norman tongue.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I believe, sir, that the Doctor is trying to tell you that he is happy because he has finished
			his book. It has taken him ten years.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			(<i>Sympathetically</i>) Yes, well, I'm a slow reader myself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Here it is, sire. (<i>He produces a sheaf of manuscript</i>) A very cornerstone of English
			scholarship. This book contains every word in our beloved language.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Every single one, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Every single one, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			In that case, sir, I hope you will not object if I also offer the Doctor my most enthusiastic
			contrafibularatories.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			What, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Contrafibularatories, sir. It is a common word down our way.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Johnson takes a pencil from behind his ear. He is furious.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Damn!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He starts writing in the dictionary.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I am anaspeptic, phrasmotic, even compunctious to have caused you such
			periconbobulations.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			What, what, what?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He's now frantic, scribbling down all these new words.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Look, what are you on about, Blackadder? This is beginning to sound a bit like dago talk to me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm sorry, sir. I merely wished to congratulate Dr Johnson on not having left out a single word.
			(<i>He smiles at Johnson, Johnson glares</i>) Shall I fetch the tea, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, yes - and get that damn fire up here, will you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Smoothly</i>) Certainly, sir. I shall return ... interphrastically.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A smug nod and he leaves.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			So, Dr Johnson. Sit ye down. Now, this book of yours. Tell me, what's it all about?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			It is a book about the English language, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I see. And the hero's name is what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			There is no hero, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			No hero? Well! Lucky I reminded you! Better put one in pronto. Call him George, that's a good name
			for a hero. What about heroines?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			There is no heroine, sir - unless it is our Mother Tongue.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah - the mother's the heroine. Nice twist. So how far have we got then? Old Mother Tongue is in
			love with George the hero... Now what about murders? Mother Tongue doesn't get murdered, does
			she?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			No, she doesn't! No one gets murdered! Or married! Or in a tricky situation over a pound note!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, now, look Dr Johnson, I may he as thick as a whale omelette, but even I know that a book's
			got to have a plot.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Not this one, sir. It is a book that tells you what English words mean.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			But I know what English words mean. I speak English. You must be a bit of a thicko!<br />
			<br />
			<i>That is it. Johnson is seriously angry. He rises to his feet.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Perhaps you would rather not be patron of my hook, sir, if you can see no value in it whatsoever!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Perhaps so, sir, since it sounds to me as though being patron of this complete cowpat of a book
			will set the seal once and for all on my reputation as an utter turnip head.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			It is a reputation well deserved, sir! Farewell.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He marches towards the double doors and flings them open. Blackadder is revealed very calmly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Leaving already, Doctor? Not staying for your pendigestatory interludicule?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			No, sir, show me out!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Certainly. sir. Anything I can do to facilitate your velocitous extramuralization.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			(<i>To Prince George</i>) You will regret this doubly, sir. Not only have you impeculiated (<i>
			he glares with self-satisfaction at Blackadder, who is not impressed</i>) my dictionary, you have
			also lost the chance to act as patron to the only book in the world that is even better.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what's that, sir? <i> Dictionary 2: The Return of the Killer Dictionaries?</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			No, sir - it is Edmund: A Butler's Tale by Gertrude Perkins.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder nearly drops the teapot he is holding.</i><br />
			<br />
			A huge roller-coaster of a novel crammed with sizzling gypsies. Had you supported it, sir, it
			would have made you and me and Gertrude millionaires.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>With real anguish</i>) Millionaires!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			But that, sir, is not to be. I bid you farewell. I shall not return.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He exits in a fury.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Excuse me, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shoots out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: THE VESTIBULE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Outside the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Dr Johnson, sir, a word, I beg you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			A word with you, sir, can mean seven million syllables. You may start it now and not be finished
			by bedtime. Oh, blast my eyes! In my fury I have left my dictionary with your foolish master. Go
			and fetch it, will you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, the prince is young and foolish, and has a peanut for a brain. Give me just a few minutes
			and I will deliver both the book and his patronage.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Oh, will you, sir? I very much doubt it. A servant who is an influence for the good is like a
			dog who speaks. Very rare.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think I can change his mind.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Well, I doubt it, sir. A man who can change a prince's mind is like a dog who talks Norwegian -
			even rarer. I shall be at Mrs Miggins's literary salon in twenty minutes. Bring the book there.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He storms out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George is standing in front of a raging fire of Baldrick's making.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Your Highness ... may I offer my congratulations.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Thanks Blackadder! That pompous baboon won't be back in a hurry! He laughs contentedly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			On the contrary, sir. Dr Johnson left in the highest of spirits.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			He is utterly thrilled at your promise to patronize his dictionary.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I told him to sod off, didn't I?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, but that was a joke. Surely.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			(<i>Confused</i>) Was it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Certainly. And a brilliant one, what's more.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, I suppose it was rather, wasn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So, may I deliver your note of patronage to Dr Johnson as promised?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, of course, if that's what I promised, then that is what I must do. And I remember
			promising it distinctly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Excellent. Nice fire, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Thank you, Mr B.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, let's get the book. Baldrick, where's the manuscript?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You mean the papery thing tied up with string?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Baldrick, the manuscript belonging to Dr Johnson.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You mean the batey fellow in the black coat who just left?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Baldrick, Dr Johnson.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			So you're asking where the papery thing tied up with string belonging to the batey fellow in
			the black coat who just left is?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Baldrick, I am. And if I do not shortly have an answer, the booted boney thing with five
			toes on the end of my leg will soon connect sharply with the soft dangly collection of objects
			in your trousers. For the last time, Baldrick, where is Dr Johnson's manuscript?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick </b><br />
			On the fire.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder </b><br />
			On the what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			The hot orangey thing under the stoney mantelpiecey thing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Aghast</i>) You've burnt the dictionary?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That's right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You've burnt the life's work of England's foremost man of letters?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yup. You did say burn any old rubbish.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder has nearly turned to stone.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, fine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Isn't it going to be rather difficult to patronize this book if we've burnt it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, it is. If you will excuse me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Of course, now I've got my lovely fire I'm happy as a Frenchman who's invented a pair of
			self-removing trousers.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick! Would you join me in the vestibule?<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: THE VESTIBULE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder grabs Baldrick by the collar.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We are going to go to Mrs Miggins's, we are going to find out where Dr Johnson keeps his copy
			of his dictionary and then you are going to steal it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Me!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Why me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Because you burnt it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But then I'll go to hell for ever for stealing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, believe me, eternity in the company of Beelzebub and all his hellish instruments of
			death will be a picnic compared to five minutes with me and this pencil (<i>He holds it
			threateningly in his hand</i>) if we can't replace this dictionary.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: MRS MIGGINS'S COFFEE SHOP</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Mrs Miggins's Coffee Shop has become fashionable with the literati. Lounging in poses of
			bored, sensitive, ill health are Byron and Shelley. Coleridge has passed out at the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Shelley</b><br />
			Oh love-loin ecstasy that is Mrs Miggins, wilt thou but bring me one cup of the browned
			juicings of that naughty bean we call coffee, ere I die?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He coughs pathetically into a handkerchief</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oh, you do have a way with words, Mr Shelley!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Byron</b><br />
			(<i>A furious figure</i>) To hell with his fine talking. Coffee, woman!!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He coughs too.</i><br />
			<br />
			My consumption grows ever more acute, and Coleridge's drugs are wearing off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oh, Mr Byron. Don't be such a big girl's blouse!<br />
			<br />
			<i>She hands Shelley a coffee.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: OUTSIDE MRS MIGGINS'S COFFEE SHOP</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Baldrick are standing outside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't forget the pencil, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I won't, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: MRS MIGGINS'S COFFEE SHOP</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters. Baldrick sits at a table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good day to you, Mrs Miggins. A cup of your best hot water with brown grit in it, unless of
			course by some miracle your coffee shop has started selling coffee...<br />
			<br />
			<i>The three poets sit up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Byron</b><br />
			Be quiet, sir! Can't you see we're dying?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They slump down again. Blackadder gives them a withering look.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oh, don't you worry about my poets, Mr Blackadder! They're not dead, they're just being
			intellectual.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mrs Miggins, there's nothing intellectual about wandering round Italy in a big shirt trying
			to get laid. Why are they here, of all places?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Byron</b><br />
			We are here, sir, to pay homage to the great Dr Johnson. As, sir, should you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Absolutely, I intend to. (<i>Casually</i>) You wouldn't have a copy of his dictionary on you,
			would you, so I can do a bit of revising up before he gets here?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Dr Johnson.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Friends, I am returned.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Poets</b><br />
			Hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Byron</b><br />
			So, sir, how was the prince?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			The prince was and is, sirs, an utter fool. And his household full of cretinous servants.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The poets laugh.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Suavely</i>) Good afternoon, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Ah - and this is the worst of them. Sir, after all your boasting, have you my dictionary and
			my patronage?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not quite. The prince begs a few hours more to really get to grips with it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Bah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			However, I was wondering if a lowly servant such as I might be permitted to glance at a copy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Copy? Copy? There is no copy!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder does turn to stone.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No copy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			No. A copy, sir, is like fitting wheels to a tomato - time-consuming and completely nnecessary.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But what if the book got lost?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			I should not lose the book, sir, and if any other man should, I would tear off his head with
			my bare hands and feed it to the cat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, that's nice and clear.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The poets draw their swords.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Byron</b><br />
			And I, Lord Byron, would summon up fifty of my men, lay siege to the fellow's house and do
			bloody murder on him.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He lays his sword threateningly on Baldrick I shoulder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Coleridge</b><br />
			And I would not rest until the criminal was hanging by his hair with an Oriental disembowelling
			cutlass thrust up his ignoble behind.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He holds his sword's point at Blackadder's throat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I hope you're listening to all this, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir. I have been unable to replace the dictionary. I am therefore leaving immediately for
			Nepal, where I intend to live as a goat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Why?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Because if I stay here, Dr Johnson's companions will have me brutally murdered, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Good Lord, Blackadder, that's terrible! Do yon know any other butlers?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And of course, when people discover that you have burnt Dr Johnson's dictionary, they may go
			round saying, 'Look, there's thick George, he's got a brain the size of a weasel's wedding
			tackle.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, in that case, something must be done!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I have a cunning plan, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Hurrah! Well, that's that, then.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't get over-excited, sir. I've a horrid suspicion that Baldrick's plan will be the stupidest
			thing we've heard since Lord Nelson's famous signal at the Battle of the Nile: 'England knows
			Lady Hamilton's a virgin, poke my eye out and cut off my arm if I'm wrong.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Great, let's hear it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder resigns himself to the worst and looks at the ceiling.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It's brilliant. You take the string that's not completely burnt, scrape off the soot, and
			shove in the pages again.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Which pages?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well not the same ones, of course.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. I think I'm on the point of spotting the flaw in the plan. But do go on. Which pages
			are they?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			This is the brilliant bit. You write some new ones.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Some new ones? You mean rewrite the dictionary? I sit down tonight, and rewrite the dictionary
			that took Johnson ten years.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, that is by far and away without a shadow of a doubt the worst and most contemptible
			plan in the history of the universe. On the other hand, I hear the sound of disembowelling
			cutlasses being sharpened, and it's the only plan we've got. So, if you will excuse me, gentlemen...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Perhaps you'd like me to lend a hand. I'm not as stupid as I look.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I am as stupid as I look, sir, but if I can help, I will.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, it's very kind of you both, but I fear your services might he as useful as a barber's
			shop on the steps of the guillotine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, go on, Blackadder, give us a try!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Very well, sir, as you wish. Let's start at the beginning, shall we? First 'a'. How would
			you define 'a'?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah - I love this. Quizzes. Ahm... a ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			(<i>Simultaneously</i>) Ahm, oh yes. Ahm, let's see - it's coming - ahm...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, I've got it!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			(<i>Proudly</i>) Well, it doesn't really mean anything, does it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>With veiled sarcasm</i>) Good, so we're well under way then. '"a" - impersonal pronoun.
			Doesn't really mean anything.' So, next - 'a' - 'a b'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			A bee. Well, that's a buzzing thing. 'A buzzing thing'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, I mean something that starts with 'ab'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Honey. Honey starts with a bee.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			He's right, you know, Blackadder. Honey does start with a bee! And a flower too.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. I'm afraid this really isn't getting anywhere. And besides, I've left out 'aardvark'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh! Well, can't say we didn't try.	<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, my lord, it was a brave stab - but I fear I shall have to proceed on my own. Baldrick -
			go to the kitchen and make me something quick and simple to eat. Perhaps two slices of bread
			with something in between.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Like Gerald, Lord Sandwich, had the other day?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes - a few rounds of Geralds.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is very late at night. Blackadder is surrounded by scrunched paper in Prince George's
			study. Prince George wanders out in his dressing-gown.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			How goes it, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not all that well, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Let's have a look.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes the piece of paper Blackadder is working on, as Blackadder leans back in despair.</i><br />
			<br />
			'Medium sized insectivore with protruding nasal implement.' Doesn't sound like a bee to me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Suddenly cracking with the strain</i>) It's an 'aardvark'! Can't you see that, your
			Highness, it's a bloody aardvark!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, dear - still on 'aardvark' are we?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, we are. If ever I see an aardvark, I'm going to step on its damn protruding nasal
			implement until it couldn't suck up an insect if its life depended on it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Got a bit stuck, have you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, I'm sorry, sir. It is five hours later and I've got every word in the English language
			except 'a' and 'aardvark' still to do. And I'm not very happy with my definition of either of
			them.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, don't panic, Blackadder, because I have some rather good news.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			We didn't take 'no' for an answer, and have, in fact, been working all night. I've done 'b'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Really? How's it gone?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, I had a bit of trouble with 'belching' - but I think I've got it sorted out in the end.
			(<i>Belches</i>) Oh, no. There I go again.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He laughs uproariously.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You've been working on that joke for some time, haven't you, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, yes, as a matter of fact I have.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Since you started?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Basically.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So you haven't done any work at all?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Not as such.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, what have you done?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I've done 'c' and 'd'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Let's hear it then.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			'Big blue wobbly thing that mermaids live in.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What's that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Sea.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, tiny misunderstanding - still, my hopes weren't high. What about 'd'?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm quite pleased with 'dog'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes? And the definition of 'dog' is...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			'Not a cat.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Excellent, excellent. (<i>To Prince George</i>) Your Highness - may I have a word?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Certainly.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes Prince George aside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			As you know, sir, it has always been my intention to stay with you until you had a strapping
			son and I one likewise, to take over the burdens of my duties.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			That's right, Blackadder, and I thank you for it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But I'm afraid, sir, there has been a change of plan. I'm off to the kitchen to hack my head
			off with a big knife.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, come now, Blackadder, it's only a book! Let's just damn the fellow's eyes, strip the
			britches from his backside and warm his heels to Putney Bridge! Hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My lord, these are not the days of Alfred the Great. You can't just lop someone's head off
			and blame it on the Vikings.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Can't I, by God!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, well, all right then - let's just get on with it. Boil my brains, it's only a dictionary,
			no one's asked us to eat ten raw pigs for breakfast. We're British, aren't we?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You're not, you're German. Get me some coffee, Baldrick - if I fall asleep before Monday,
			we're doomed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWELVE: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is asleep and snoring. Baldrick wakes him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Mr Blackadder, time to wake up!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah! What time is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Monday morning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Monday morning! Oh, my God! I've overslept. Where's the quill? Where's the parchment?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I don't know - maybe Dr Johnson's brought some with him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Terrified</i>) What!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			He's outside.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder screams. Enter Dr Johnson.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Are you ill, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Wildly</i>) No - you can't have it. I know I said Monday, but I want Baldrick to read
			it, which unfortunately will mean teaching him to read, which will take about ten years.
			But time well spent, I think, because it is such a very good dictionary.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			I don't think so.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh no, we've been burgled! (<i>Double take</i>) What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			I think it's an awful dictionary, full of feeble definitions and ridiculous verbiage. I've
			come to ask you to chuck the damn thing on the fire.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Are you sure?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			I've never been more sure of anything in my life.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I love you, Dr Johnson, and I want to have your babies.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They embrace.</i><br />
			<br />
			(<i>Looking puzzled</i>) Excuse me, Dr Johnson, but my Auntie Margery has just arrived.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A lady is standing behind him. Blackadder turns to Baldrick, who has now turned into a dog.</i><br />
			<br />
			Baldrick, who gave you permission to turn into an Alsatian?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The awful realization dawns.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh God, it's a dream, isn't it, it's a bloody dream...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Auntie Margery, Dr Johnson and Baldrick the Alsatian dance out of the room.</i><br />
			<br />
			Dr Johnson doesn't want us to burn his dictionary at all.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THIRTEEN: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is waking up Blackadder. It is exactly the same set-up as a few seconds earlier.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Mr Blackadder, Mr Blackadder, time to wake up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, what time is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Monday morning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Monday morning? Oh my God! I've overslept. Where's the quill? Where's the parchment?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I don't know. Maybe Dr Johnson's got some with him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Terrified</i>) What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			He's outside.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hang on, hang on. If we go on like this you're going to turn into an Alsatian again.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Sorry?<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is knocking and roaring from outside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh God, quick - we've got to escape.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOURTEEN: THE VESTIBULE OF PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Dr Johnson and the poets are standing outside the prince's rooms.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Shelley</b><br />
			Ho, sir, bring out the dictionary at once!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Byron</b><br />
			Bring it out, sir! Or in my passion I shall kill everyone by giving them syphilis...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Coleridge</b><br />
			Bring it out! And also any opium plants you might have around!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Sir, bring it out or we shall break down this door!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder emerges with Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah. Good morning, Dr Johnson, Lord Byron...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			My dictionary?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what dictionary would this be?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Dr Johnson starts walking forward, pushing Blackadder back with his cane followed by
			the poets brandishing their swords. They end up at the doors of the prince's bed-chamber.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			The one that took me eighteen hours in every day for the last ten years ... My mother died
			- I hardly noticed. My father cut off his head and fried it with garlic in the hope of
			attracting my attention - I scarcely looked up from my work. My wife brought armies of
			lovers to our house, who worked in droves so that she might bring up a huge family of
			bastards - I eared not.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Am I to presume, sir, my elaborate bluff has not worked?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Dictionary!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well the truth is, Doctor ... Now don't get cross. Don't overreact. The truth is ... we
			burnt it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Then - you die!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is about to die. At which moment, Prince George enters from the bedroom
			casually carrying a large manuscript.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Good morning, everyone. You know, this dictionary is a cracking good read, an absolutely
			splendid job.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			My dictionary! But you said it was burnt!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			I think it's a splendid book and look forward to patronizing it enormously.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Well, thank you, sir. Well, I think I'm man enough to sacrifice the pleasure of killing
			to maintain the general good humour. (<i>To the poets</i>) There is to be no murder
			today, gentlemen.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The poets groan with disappointment.</i><br />
			<br />
			But retire to Mrs Miggins's - I shall meet you there for a roister you will never forget.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Poets cheer and leave. All is resolved.</i><br />
			<br />
			Tell me, sir, what words particularly interested you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ahmm... oh, nothing. Just... anything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			I see you have underlined a few... 'bloomers', 'bottom', 'burp' ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns the pages, worried.</i><br />
			<br />
			'Fart', 'fiddle', 'fornicate' ... Sir! I hope that you are not using this first English
			dictionary to look up rude words.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I wouldn't be too hopeful - that's what all the other ones will be used for.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Can I look up 'turnip'?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			'Turnip' isn't a rude word, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It is if you sit on one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Yes, sir. But now we have more important business in hand. I refer of course to the works
			of the mysterious Gertrude Perkins.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mysterious no more, sir, it is time for the truth. I can at last reveal the identity of
			the great Gertrude Perkins.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Sir - who is she?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			She, sir, is me, sir. I am Gertrude Perkins.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Good Lord!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what's more, I can prove it. Bring out the manuscript and I will show you that my
			signature corresponds exactly with that on the front.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Why, I must have left it here when I left the dictionary.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			This is terribly exciting.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Excellent Baldrick - fetch my novel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Your novel?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Baldrick - it's the big papery thing tied up with string.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Like the thing we burnt.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Exactly like the thing we burnt.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			So, you want the big papery thing tied up with string exactly like the thing we burnt.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Exactly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			We burnt it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Suddenly, Blackadder realizes the terrible twist of fate that has occurred and will
			blight his life for ever.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So we did. Thank you, Baldrick ... seven years of my life up in smoke. Your Highness,
			would you excuse me a moment?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			By all means.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder goes out of the room, shutting the doors behind him. Outside, the cry of
			a man in total agony is heard.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			OH GOD, NO!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He re-enters, calm once more.</i><br />
			<br />
			Thank you, sir. <br />
			 <br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			Burnt you say? That's most inconvenient. A burnt novel, sir, is like a burnt dog...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, shut up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I have a novel, sir...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He produces a scrap of paper for Johnson.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Johnson</b><br />
			(<i>Reading</i>) 'Once upon a time there was a lovely little sausage called...' Sausage!
			Sausage! Blast your eyes!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Irrationally and unreasonably, Johnson screws up the paper and storms out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well I didn't think it was that bad.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(Leafing despondently through dictionary</i>) I think you'll find he left 'sausage'
			out of his dictionary.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He has another thought and looks at the beginning.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, and 'aardvark'...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He puts it aside gloomily.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Come on, Blackadder, it's not all that bad. Nothing a nice roaring fire can't solve.
			Baldrick - do the honours, will you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Certainly, your Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He looks around, picks up the dictionary, walks behind the other two to the fire,
			and throws it in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Freeze. As the greatest work of English lexicography begins to flame.</i>
