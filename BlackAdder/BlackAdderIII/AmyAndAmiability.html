			<b>SCENE ONE: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder sits at breakfast and is overwhelmed by unfriendly mail.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God, bills, bills, bills. One is born, one runs up bills, one dies. And what have I got to
			show for it? Nothing! A butler's uniform and a slightly effeminate hairdo. Honestly, Baldrick,
			sometimes I feel like a pelican - whichever way I turn, I've still got au enormous bill in front
			of me. Pass the biscuit barrel. Let's see what's in the kitty, shall we? (<i>He empties it</i>)
			Nine pence. Oh, God, what are we going to do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Don't worry, Mr B. I have a cunning plan to solve the problem.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Baldrick. Let us not forget, you tried to solve the problem of your mother's low ceiling
			by cutting off her head.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, but this is a really good one. You become a dashing highwayman. Then you can pay your bills
			and, on top of that, everyone will want to sleep with you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, I could become a prostitute and pay my bills and everyone would want to sleep with me,
			but I do consider certain professions beneath me. Besides which, I fail to see why a common thief
			should be idolized just because he has a horse between his legs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My favourite is the Shadow. What a man. They say he's half way to being a new Robin Hood.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Why only half way?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, he steals from the rich, but he hasn't got round to giving it to the poor. Look! I've got
			a poster of him.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He produces a poster of a man in hat and kerchief. It reads:</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>     Wanted for</b><br />
			<b>       Hanging</b><br />
			<b>   The Shadow</b><br />
			<b>Reward: £1,000</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I've no desire to get hung for wearing a silly hat. If I want to get rich quick all I need to
			do is to go upstairs and ask Prince Fathead for a rise.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A ring on the bell.</i><br />
			<br />
			Ah! The bank's open.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George is sitting at his desk - it is also a mess of papers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good morning, sir. May I say how immensely rich you're looking. Now, was there anything you
			wanted, sir. Anything at all? Absolutely anything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, yes, old fellow, I was wondering if you could possibly lend me a bit of cash.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But of course, sir, I ... cash?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, I'm rotten stinking stony broke.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But, sir - what about the £5,000 Parliament voted to give you to drink yourself to death with?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			All gone, I'm afraid - you see, I've discovered this terrifically fun new game - it's called
			'cards'. What happens is, you sit round a table with all your friends, deal out five 'cards'
			and then the object of the game is to give all your money away as quickly as possible. Do you
			know it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Vaguely, sir, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			All the chaps say I'm terrific at it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I seem to remember I was very bad at it. I always seemed to end up with more money than I started
			with.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah, yes, it's all down to practice - I'm a natural apparently. The only drawback, of course,
			is that it's pretty damn expensive. So basically, I was wondering if you could just lend me a
			couple of hundred.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm afraid that's impossible, sir. I'm as poor as a church mouse, that's just had an enormous
			tax bill on the very day his wife ran off with another mouse, taking all the cheese.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			What am I going to do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, it's a difficult one. Well, let's see now, you can't borrow money. You're not going to
			inherit money and obviously you can't earn money. Sir, drastic situations call for drastic measures. If you can't make money, you'll have to marry it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Marry! Never! I'm a gay bachelor, Blackadder. I'm a roarer, a rogerer, a gorger and a puker!
			I can't marry, I'm young, I'm firm buttocked, I'm...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Broke.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, yes, I suppose so.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And don't forget, sir, that the modern church smiles upon roaring and gorging within wedlock
			and, indeed, rogering is keenly encouraged.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			And the puking?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I believe still very much down to the conscience of the individual churchgoer.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, well, tally-ho. Blackadder, fix it up. You know the kind of girls I like. They've got to
			he lovers, laughers, dancers.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And honkers.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, that goes without saying.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is consulting a large tome. Baldrick is gutting a chicken. Blackadder slams the
			book shut.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Something wrong, Mr B?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. I can't find a single person suitable to marry the prince.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, please keep trying - I love a royal wedding, the excitement, the crowds, the souvenir mugs.
			The worrying about whether the bride has lost weight...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Unlikely with this lot, I'm afraid, if the prince had stipulated 'must weigh a quarter of a ton',
			we'd be laughing. Of the 262 princesses in Europe, 165 are over 80 - they're out - 47 are under
			10 - they're out - and 39 are mad.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			They sound ideal.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			They would be if they hadn't all got married last week in Munich to the same horse. Which leaves
			us with two.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, what about them?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, there's Grand Duchess Sophia of Turin - well never get her to marry him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Why not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Because she's met him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Which leaves<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Princess Caroline of Brunswick as the only available princess in Europe.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			And what's wrong with her?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Suddenly shouting</i>) Get more coffee! It's horrid, change it! Take me roughly from behind!
			No, not like that, like this! Trousers off, tackle out! Walk the dog! Where's my present?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is very, very shaken by this outburst.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			All right! Which one do you want me to do first?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No - that's what Caroline's like. She is famous for having the worst personality in Germany and,
			as you can imagine, that's up against some pretty stiff competition.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			So you're stuck then.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, I'm afraid I am. Unless ... unless. Pass me the paper, Baldrick, quick...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick gets the paper. It looks shredded.</i><br />
			<br />
			Baldrick, why has half of the front page been cut out?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I don't know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You do know, don't you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You've been cutting out the cuttings about the elusive Shadow to put in your highwayman scrap
			book, haven't you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, I can't help it, Mr B! His life is so dark and shadowy and full of fear and trepidation!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So's going to the toilet in the middle of the night but you don't keep a scrap book on it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, I do.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now, let me see ... the society pages. You see, Baldrick, it needn't necessarily be a princess.
			All the prince wants is someone pretty and rich.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh dear - that rules me out then.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now, let's see - 'Beau Brummel in purple pants probe', 'King talks to tree. Phew! What a Loony'.
			God, The Times has really gone downhill recently. Ahaa! Listen to this: 'Mysterious Northern
			beauty, Miss Amy Hardwood, comes to London and spends flipping great wodges of cash.' Aha! That's
			our baby.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is brushing down Prince George's coat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Honestly, Blackadder, I don't know why I'm bothering to get dressed - the moment I get to the
			Naughty Hell Fire Club I'll be de-bagged and radished for non-payment of debts.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Radished, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes. They take your britches down, and then push a large radish up your.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, yes, it's all right, sir. There's no need to hammer it home.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, as a matter of fact, they do often ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, no, no! Your money worries are over, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, hurrah for that.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I've found you a bride. Her name is Amy, daughter of the noted industrialist, Mr Hardwood.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, dammit Blackadder. You know I loathe industrialists! Sad balding little proles in their
			damn-yer-eyes weskits. All puffed up just because they know where to put the legs on a pair
			of trousers.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Believe me, sir, these people are the future. This man probably owns half of Lancashire. His
			family's got more mills than you've got brain cells.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			How many mills?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Seven, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Quite a lot of mills.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes - he has patented a machine called the Ravelling Nancy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			What does it do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It ravels cotton, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			What for?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That, I cannot say, sir. I'm one of those people who are quite happy to wear cotton but have
			no idea how it works.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He changes the subject.</i><br />
			<br />
			She is also a beauty, sire.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			If she's going to be my bird, she'd better be. Right, so what's the plan?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I thought I could take her a short note expressing your honourable intentions.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, I think so too. All right then, take this down... 'From His Royal Highness the Prince
			of Wales to Miss Army Hardwood. Tally ho, my fine saucy young trollop, your luck's in. Trip
			along here with all your cash and some naughty night attire, and you'll be staring at my
			bedroom ceiling from now till Christmas, yun lucky tart! Yours with deepest respect, etc.,
			signed George. PS Woof! Woof!' Well, what do you think?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's very moving, sir. Would you mind if I - change just one tiny aspect?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Which one?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The words, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, I'll leave the details to you, Blackadder - just make sure she knows I'm all man, with
			a bit of animal thrown in. Worrr!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Certainly, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: AMY HARDWOOD'S ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The room is very fluffy and pretty. Blackadder is reading to Amy, who is a total drip. It
			is not quite the same letter.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			From His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to Miss Amy Hardwood.<br />
			<br />
			The upturned tilt of your tiny wee nosey, Smells as sweet as a great big posy. Fanciful stuff
			of course, madam, but from the heart.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			He says my nosey is tiny?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And wee, madam.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			Well, I must say, he must be a clever clogs because you see my nosey is tiny and so wee that
			I sometimes think the pixies gave it me.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She gives a tiny tinkling laugh. Blackadder is stony - faced. Not really his type of woman.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			He continues ... 'Oh, Lady Amy, queen of all your sex' ... I apologize for the word, madam,
			but Prince George is a man of passion.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			Oh, don't worry - I can get pretty cross myself sometimes. Tell me, Mr Blackadder, I've heard
			a teensy rumour that the prince has the manners of a boy cow's dingle dangle what do you have
			to say to that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, that is a lie, madam. The Prince Regent is shy and pretends to be bluff and crass and
			unbelievably thick and gittish. Whilst deep down he is a soft little marshmallowy piglet type
			of creature.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			Oh, I am so glad. You see, I am a delicate tiny thing myself, weak and silly and like a little
			fluffy rabbit. So I could never marry a horrible heffalump or I might get squished. When can
			I meet the lovely prince?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You want to meet him?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			lf we're going to get married, I think I probably ought to. I know, tell him to come and
			serenade me, tonight - I'll be on my balcony in my jim jams.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Certainly, madam.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He is about to go when Mr Hardwood enters. A definitively bluff Northerner.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			Eh up... who's this big girl's blouse?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			Father, this is Mr Blackadder. He's come a-wooing from the prince.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You have a beautiful and charming daughter, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			Indeed I do - I love her more than any pig, and that's saying summat,<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It certainly is.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			But, let me tell you, I would no more place her in the hands of an unworthy man than I'd
			place my John Thomas in the hands of a lunatic with a pair of scissors.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			An attitude that does you credit, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			I'd rather take all my clothes off and paint my bottom blue than give her to a man who
			didn't love her.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What self-respecting father could do more?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			On the other hand, if it's the prince, he can have her for ten bob and a pickled egg.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I can see where your daughter gets her ready wit, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			I thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Although where she gets her good looks and charm is perhaps more of a mystery.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			No one ever made money out of good looks and charm.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You obviously haven't met Lady Hamilton, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is stuffing a chicken whilst Blackadder wanders around the room behind him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'll tell you, Baldrick, I'm not looking forward to this evening, trying to serenade a
			light, fluffy, bunny of a girl in the company of an arrogant, half - German yob with a
			mad dad.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			He is the Prince of Wales.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Have yon ever been to Wales, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, but I've often thought I'd like to.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, don't. It's a ghastly place, huge gangs of tough, sinewy men roam the valleys
			terrifying people with their close-harmony singing. You need half a pint of phlegm in your
			throat just to pronounce the place names. Never ask for directions in Wales, Baldrick -
			you'll be washing spit out of your hair for a fortnight.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			So being prince of it isn't considered a plus?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I fear not. No - the crucial thing is that they must never be left alone together before
			the marriage.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Isn't that a bit unfair on her?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's not particularly fair on him either - the girl is wetter than a haddock's bathing
			costume. But you know, Baldrick - the world isn't fair. If ii was, things like this wouldn't
			happen, would they?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hits Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: THE HARDWOODS' BALCONY</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and the prince are under the balcony, whispering.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Right, so what's the plan again? Shin up the drain and ask if she'll take delivery of a
			consignment of German sausage?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, sir. As we rehearsed, poetry first - sausage later.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Oh, all right. Do you think 'Harold the Horny Hunter' should do the trick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Er, remind me of it, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			'Harold the Horny Hunter, Had an enormous Horn ...'<br />
			<br />
			<i>He'd love to finish this delicate masterpiece, but Blackadder corrects him ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. It is absolutely excellent, sir. However, might I suggest an alternative?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder takes the lyrics from his pocket and hands them to Prince George.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			'Lovely little dumpling, How in love I am. Let me be your shepherdkins, And you can be
			my lamb.'<br />
			<br />
			Well, I think we'll he very lucky if she doesn't just come out on to the balcony and vomit
			over us, but still. Let's give it a whirl.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right. Just stand right here, sir. Call for her romantically.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Righto. (<i>Steadies himself - then with huge and hideous volume</i>) OH, COME ON OUT,
			YOU ROLLICKING TROLLOPING SAUCE BOTTLE. WOOF! WOOF!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder clamps his hand over Prince George's mouth and pushes him behind a stone
			plant pot. Amy comes out on to the balcony.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			George?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Woof! Woof!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			Is that you?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder feels he has to intercede.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, yes, 'tis I, your gorgeous little love-bundle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			Oh. George, I think you must be the snuggly wuggliest lambkin in the whole of toy land!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yucch!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			What was that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Nothing, nothing. Just a little fly in my throaty. (<i>Coughs</i>) Yucch, yucch.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			Do you want a hanky wanky to gob the phlegmy wemmy woo woo into?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Amy takes a hanky from her bosom.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Phwoorrr! Crikey!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			Is there someone else down there with you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, it's just the wind whistling through the trees and making a noise that sounded like
			'Phwoorrr! Crikeeeee!'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			Oh, joy. Then come, Prince Cuddly Kitten, climb up my ivy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince George stands up and strides towards the balcony.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Sausage time!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			There is someone down there with you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, my God, yes, so there is - a filthy intruder, spying on our love.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			Oh, hit him, George - hit him!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Very well. (<i>To Prince George</i>) Would you mind screaming your Highness? Take that.
			And that! And that!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He actually hits Prince George.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And that.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hits him again. Prince George falls to the ground.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			Oooh, you're so brave. And I'm so worn out with the excitement I'd better go sleepie
			bobos or I'll be all cross in the morning - nighty night, Georgy Porgy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Nighty, wighty, Amy Wamy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She goes in. Blackadder helps the prince up.</i><br />
			<br />
			I think it worked, sir. Tomorrow morning I'll go in and ask her father. You go out and
			start spending his money. I can't stand meanness when it comes to wedding presents. And
			well done, sir, you were brilliant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Was I?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			But I'm in agony.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, that's love for you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: AMY HARDWOOD'S ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder stands before Mr Hardwood.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, I come as emissary of the Prince Regent with the most splendid news. He wants your
			daughter Amy for his wife.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			Well, his wife can't have her. Outrageous, sir, to come here with such a suggestion. Mind,
			sir, or I shall take off my belt and, by thunder, my trousers will fall down.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, sir, you misunderstand, he wants to marry your lovely daughter.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			(<i>Thrilled</i>) Oh. Can it possibly be true? Surely love has never crossed such
			boundaries of class.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			What about you and Mum?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			Well, yes, I grant thee - when I first met her, I was the farmer's son, and she was just
			the lass who ate the dung. But that was an exception.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			And Aunty Dot and Uncle Ted?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			Yes, all right - he was a pig poker and she was the Duchess of Argyll, but...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			And Aunty Ruth and Uncle Isaiah. She was a milkmaid and he was...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			The pope. Yes, all right, lass, don't argue. Suffice it to say, if you marry we need
			never be poor or hungry again. Sir, we accept.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good, so obviously you'll be wanting an enormous ceremony ... What did you say?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			Well, obviously now we re marrying quality ... we'll never be poor or hungry again.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Meaning... that you're poor and hungry at the moment?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			Oh, yes - we've been living off lard butties for five years now. I'm so poor I use my
			underpants for drying dishes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So you're skint?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hardwood</b><br />
			Aye.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			In that case, the wedding's off, good day.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			But what about George's lovey wovey poems that won my hearty wearty?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All writteny witteny by me-ee we-ee, I'm afraidy waidy. Goodbye.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He exits with callous abruptness.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Amy</b><br />
			Aaaahhh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>She beats the door in love-loin despair</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters, worried.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir. You know I told you to go out and spend a lot of money on presents, well apparently ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder looks around - the entire room is utterly full of golden clutter. The
			prince is idly inspecting a golden candlestick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Nothing, sir - nothing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder storms in, throwing on his cape.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Crisis, Baldrick, crisis - no marriage, no money, more bills. I have decided for the
			first time in my life to follow a suggestion of yours. Saddle Prince George's horse.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, sir, you're not going to become a highwayman, are you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No I'm auditioning for the part of Arnold the Bat in Sheridan's new comedy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, that's all right then.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, have you no idea what irony is?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, it's like goldy and bronzy only it's made out of iron.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder picks up a tricornered hat and puts it on.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Never mind. Never mind. Just saddle the prince's horse.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes two pistols out of a box.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That'll he difficult, sir - he wrapped her round that gas lamp in the Strand last night.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, saddle my horse then.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What do you think you've been eating this last two months?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, go out into the street and hire me a horse.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Hire you a horse? For ninepence? On Jewish New Year? In the rain? A bare fortnight after the
			dreaded Horse Plague of Old London Town with the blacksmiths' strike in its fifteenth week
			and the Dorset Horse-Fetishists Fair tomorrow?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He chucks bit and blinkers at Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			Well get this lot on. It looks as though you could do with some exercise.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: A STAGECOACH</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A dark and stormy night on a remote highway. The Duke of Cheapside and his daughter Sally
			are inside the stagecoach.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Sally</b><br />
			Honestly, Papa - since mother died you've tried to stop me growing up. I'm not a little girl,
			I'm a grown woman. In fact, I might as well tell you now, Papa. I'm pregnant. And I'm an opium
			fiend, and I'm in love with a poet called Shelley, who's a famous whoopsy. And mother didn't
			die, I killed her.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cheapside</b><br />
			Oh, well, never mind.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a shot.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Stand and deliver!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cheapside</b><br />
			Oh, no - disaster. It's the Shadow - we're doomed, doomed.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder's head appears at the window of the coach.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good evening, Duke, and the lovely Miss Cheapside. Your cash bags, please.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he duly takes them.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Cheapside</b><br />
			You'll never get away with this, you scoundrel. You'll be caught and damn well hung!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sally</b><br />
			(<i>Flirtily</i>) I think he looks<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Madam, please, not the jest about me looking pretty well hung already, we have no time.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sally</b><br />
			Pity.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now, sir, turn out your pockets.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cheapside</b><br />
			Never! A man's pockets are his own private kingdom. I shall protect them with my life!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I see, got something embarrassing in there, have you? Perhaps, a particularly repulsive
			handkerchief, hmmnim? One of those fellows who has a really big blow and then doesn't change
			it for a week? Let's look, shall we?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He pulls out some jewels.</i><br />
			<br />
			Aha!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sally</b><br />
			Highwayman, I also have a jewel. I fear, however, that I have placed it here, beneath my
			petticoat, for protection.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, in that ease, madam... I think I shall leave it - I'm not sure I fancy the thought
			of a jewel that's been in someone pants. A single kiss of those soft lips is all I require.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cheapside</b><br />
			Never, sir! A man's soft lips are his own private kingdom. I shall defend them with my life!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm not talking to you, grandad.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He kisses Sally.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Sally</b><br />
			Oh, I am overcome. Take me with you to live the life of the wild rogue - cuddling under
			haystacks and making love in the branches of tall trees.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Madam, sadly I must decline. I fear my horse would collapse with you on top of him as well
			as me.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick 's head appears from below the window of the stagecoach.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I could try.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, Quicksilver, you couldn't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That just isn't fair then. I carry you on my back for ten miles, and I haven't even got a
			kiss out of it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, all right, very well then...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Sally looks worried, but Blackadder kisses Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			There, all fair now?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Not really, no.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Chh, no pleasing some horses. Hi ho, Quicksilver.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They disappear</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Sally</b><br />
			Papa, you did nothing to defend my honour.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cheapside</b><br />
			Oh, shut your face, you pregnant junkie fag hag.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWELVE: A LEAFY COPSE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Baldrick sit down to count the loot in a convenient copse.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, Baldrick, a good night's work. I think it is time to divide the loot. And I think
			it is only fair that we should share it equally.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Which I presume is highwayman talk for you get the cash, I get the snotty hanky.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, no. We did the robbery together so you get half the cash.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hands over one of the bags.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			This robbery, on the other hand, I am doing alone.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He points the gun at Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			Hand it over, your money or your life.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick hands the bag back.</i><br />
			<br />
			There you are, you see, all fair and above board.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Fair enough. As long as I haven't been cheated, I don't mind.<br />
			<br />
			<i>At which point, suddenly out of the blue, another highwayman enters. It is the Shadow.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			Hands up, I am the Shadow, and I never miss.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Very depressed</i>) Oh, no.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			You, the one that looks like a pig.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			He's talking to you, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			Skedaddle!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He fires at Baldrick's feet as he scuttles off.</i><br />
			<br />
			So, who have we here?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He tears off Blackadder's mask.</i><br />
			<br />
			Well! A well set - up fellow indeed. Sir, a kiss.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sorry! I'm not sure I heard that correctly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			Oh, dear. (<i>He puts the gun to Blackadder's head</i>) Maybe your ears need unblocking.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, a kiss! Of course, of course, of course. And then perhaps a little light supper, some
			dancing, who knows where it will lead.<br />
			<br />
			<i>So, a big kiss it is, during which the Shadow pulls off his hat. Long hair cascades down.
			He is a she, and she is Amy. At the end of kiss, she removes her mask.</i><br />
			<br />
			Good Lord. It's you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			Of course.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But your voice?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			Clever, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Does your father know you're out?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			He had to go.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You mean, he's dead?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			Yes. Dead as that squirrel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Which squirrel?<br />
			<br />
			<i>She shoots at a tree, there is a little squeak, followed by a little thud.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, that squirrel. Of course! You killed your father for ruining your chances of a marriage
			to Prince George.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			Ha! I despise the prince. Don't you know it's you I want? I want a real man. A man who can
			sew on a button. A man who knows where the towels are kept.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder smiles bashfully.</i><br />
			<br />
			And yes - I crave your fabulous sinewy body.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, you're only human.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			Here's the plan, Brown Eyes: you rob the prince of everything he's got, right down to the
			clothes he's standing in. I'll get my stash and meet you here. Then we'll run away to the
			West Indies.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I don't know, I'll have to think about it. (<i>No pause</i>) I've thought about it,
			it's a brilliant idea. See you here tomorrow<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THIRTEEN: THE KITCHEN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is packing pictures and silver on to a cart.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, I'm off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, sir, but what about the danger? Look, the reward is going up day by day.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He reveals the poster, which now say's:</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>    The Shadow</b><br />
			<b>     Wanted for</b><br />
			<b>       Hanging</b><br />
			<b>Reward: £5,000</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ha - I laugh at danger and drop ice cubes down the vest of fear. Things couldn't be better.
			She'll get me abroad and make me rich. Then I'll probably drop her and get 200 concubines
			to share my bed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Won't they be rather prickly?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Concubines, Baldrick, not porcupines.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh. I still can't believe you're leaving me behind.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't worry, Baldrick - when we're established on our plantation in Barbados, I'll send for
			you. No more sad little London for you, Balders, from now on you will stand out as an individual.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Will I?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course you will, all the other slaves will be black.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder turns to the door and bumps straight into Mrs Miggins.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oh, Mr Blackadder, what's all this I hear about you buying a bathing costume and forty
			gallons of coconut oil. Are you going abroad then, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, I'm off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Miggins</b><br />
			Oh, sir - what a tragic end to all my dreams! And I'd always hoped you might settle down and
			marry me and that together we might await the slither of tiny Adders.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She catches hold of him and sobs into his waistcoat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mrs M, if we were the last three humans on earth, I would be trying to start a family with
			Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>That cruel remark breaks her heart.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOURTEEN: THE LEAFY COPSE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is dawn at the same leafy location as the night before. Blackadder wheels his cart in
			front of him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, here I am, all packed and ready to go.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			Oh, darling, I'm so pleased to see you. And I've got a little surprise. Close your eyes and
			open your month.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder does and she puts her gun in.</i><br />
			<br />
			Hand over the loot, goat brains.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ha ha! I always say the bedrock of a good relationship is being able to laugh together. Good.
			Well done. Now, which way to Barbados?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			You're not going to Barbados. Now, get away from the cart, Mr Slimy, or I'll fill you so
			full of lead we could sharpen your head and call you a pencil.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			This is turning into a really rotten evening.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			(<i>Beginning to tie him up</i>) Well, you'd better make the most of it - it's your last.
			And it's a pity because it's normally against my principles to shoot dumb animals.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Except squirrels?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Shadow</b><br />
			Yes. Bastards!<br />
			<br />
			<i>She looks wildly about her.</i><br />
			<br />
			I hate them with their long tails and their stupid twitchy noses!<br />
			<br />
			<i>She fires randomly and hits some squirrels.</i><br />
			<br />
			I shall return at midnight to collect the loot - when I'll fill you so full of holes I could
			market you as a new English cheese.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She exits, laughing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God, what a way to die. Shot by a transvestite on an unrealistic grassy knoll.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder has hours ahead of him - he cannot escape. At which moment of total despair ...
			enter Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Morning, Mr B.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick! Thank you for introducing me to a genuinely new experience.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What experience is that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Being pleased to see you. What are you doing here, you revolting animal?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I've come for the Shadow's autograph. You know, I'm a great fan of the Shadow's.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. Just untie me, Baldrick. Come on.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			(<i>Untying Blackadder</i>) Has he gone? Oh, what a pity. I wanted him to autograph my new
			poster. Look, his reward's gone up to £10,000.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good Lord, £10,000. That gives me an idea. Baldrick, take this cartload of loot back to the
			palace, and meet me back here at midnight with ten soldiers, a restless lynch mob and a small portable gallows.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIFTEEN: PRINCE GEORGE'S CHAMBERS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters with a breakfast tray. Prince George is reading a paper.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Ha ha! Brekkers! I could eat fourteen trays of it this morning and still have room for a
			dolphin on toast.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Any particular reason for this gluttonous levity, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Well, what do you think? I'm in love. I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love. Oh, Amy, Amy,
			bless all ten of your tiny pinkies. Now, let's see, what's in the paper? Oh, my God!!! She's
			been arrested and hanged!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, really!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			It turns out she was a highwayman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Tsk. These modern girls.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes, apparently someone tipped off the authorities and collected the £10,000 reward. What
			a greasy sneak. If only I could get my hands on him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Tsk. You can't trust anyone these days, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			It says here she had an accomplice.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder drops the tray.</i><br />
			<br />
			But they don't know who it was.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The tray jumps back into Blackadder 's hands.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, Amy, Amy, I shall never forget you! Never, ever, never, ever! Now, what's for breakfast?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He's forgotten her.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Kedgeree.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Great. Actually, come to think of it, I don't need to marry anyway. I've got pots of money.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Yes. The most extraordinary thing happened. I was peckish in the night and nipped downstairs
			to the biscuit barrel.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A cold chill grips Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The biscuit barrel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			And do you know what I found inside? Ten thousand pounds I never knew I had.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			In fact, I've got so much money I don't know what to do with it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			How about a game of cards, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince George</b><br />
			Excellent idea!
