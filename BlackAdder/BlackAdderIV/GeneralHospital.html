			<b>SCENE ONE: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The chaps are sitting around.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I spy with my little eye ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He looks at the table next to him. All that there is on it is one mug.</i><br />
			<br />
			... something beginning with ... 'm'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is totally baffled. George waggles his head at the mug.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Mmmm. Mmm.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Mmmmm.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They continue like this, getting louder, until Blackadder snaps.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mug!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, well done, sir! Your turn.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ahm, I spy with my bored little eye something beginning with ... 't'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Breakfast.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My breakfast always begins with tea, then I have a little sausage. Then an egg with some little
			soldiers.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			When I say it begins with 't', I meant a letter.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, it never begins with a letter, the postman don't come until 10.30.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I can't go on with this. George, you take over.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			All right, sir. I spy with my little eye something that begins with 'r'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Army.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			For God's Sake, Baldrick - army starts with an 'a'. He's looking for something that starts with
			an 'r'. Rrrrrr. (<i>He rolls his 'r's</i>)<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Motor bike.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Motor bike starts with an 'r', rrrr, rrrrr. He does his rolling 'r' motorbike impression.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, my turn again. What starts with 'Come here' and ends with 'Ow'?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Don't know, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, come here!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hits Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Owwww!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			No - ha, ha - I don't think you've quite got the hang of this game. Let's try another one. I hear
			with my little ear something beginning with 'b'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Bomb.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I can't hear a bomb.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Listen very carefully.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder listens. Then, casually ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh yes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>An enormous explosion outside sends debris everywhere.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE FIELD HOSPITAL WARD</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>George is in bed. He has a bandaged arm. He is reading back a letter to lovely, sweet Nurse
			Mary, sitting beside him. They are very matey.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Finished!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Come on then.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			All right and you can tell me what you think, but be honest now!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			I will!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			'Dear Uncle H, how are you?'<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mary laughs.</i><br />
			<br />
			It's good, isn't it: 'It's beastly rotten luck being laid up here but everyone's very
			nice and at least now I can write to you every day.' Oh, er, then there's a silly bit, but it's
			nothing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			No, no!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Oh, go on, you can tell me!<br />
			<br />
			<i>George is embarrassed, but pleased.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			'And the nurse is an absolute peach.' Er , oh.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mary smiles, pleased. She is soppily fond of, and gentle with him. George continues.</i><br />
			<br />
			'Captain Blackadder was marvellous, he joked and joked, "You lucky lucky lucky bastard," he cried ...
			and then he lay on his back, stuck his foot over the top of the trench and shouted, "Over here, Fritz!
			What about me!" ...'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Captain Blackadder does indeed sound like a witty, courageous chap.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes, and he's very amusing and brave as well. Not to mention being as clever as a chap with three heads.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mary ruffles George's hair and plumps up his pillows.</i><br />
			<br />
			Gosh - well, thanks ever so much. You really are terribly kind and dashed pretty to boot.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Oh, I don't know - a fluffy pillow and a big cheery smile is the least my boysies deserve. Now you
			take a little trip to Dozyland. You've got visitors corning, and we don't want to be all tired and
			crosspatch, do we?<br />
			<br />
			<i>In the spirit of it all, George starts to suck his thumb.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Absolutely not. It'll be so jolly to see Baldrick and the Cap. They'll have been worried sick about
			me, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Baldrick and Blackadder through the swing doors.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right, where is the malingering git?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Hallo, Cap! Pip pip, Balders! Here I lie!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Nice to see the lieutenant looking so well, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Course he's looking well, there's nothing wrong with him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ha, ha! Didn't I tell you, the Captain was a super cove?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			You did. Well, Captain, you're indeed fortunate to have a loyal friend like darling Georgie.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mmm. I'm afraid you're under a slight misapprehension here, Nurse - I lost closer friends than
			'darling Georgie' the last time I was deloused. Now, if you'll excuse me I've got better things
			to do than exchange pleasantries with a wet blanket. Would you get out?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mary gasps.</i><br />
			<br />
			We've got some important military business.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Well, ten minutes only then.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He points to the way out. She waves. Blackadder sits down next to George.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, porkface, where's the grub?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Pardon?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Come on - the moment that collection of inbred mutants you call your relatives heard you were sick,
			they will have sent you a hamper the size of Westminster Abbey.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			My family is not inbred!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, come on - somewhere outside Saffron Walden there's an uncle who is seven feet tall with no chin
			and an Adam's apple that makes him look as if he's constantly trying to swallow a ballcock.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I don't have any uncles like that! And anyway he lives in Walton-on-the-Naze.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Pay attention! Now where's the tuck?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, there were one or two things, yes ... a potted turkey, a cow in jelly, three
			tinned sheep, and twelve hundred chocolates, but in my weakened state ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I ... I ate them.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, Nurse Mary nibbled a trotter or two ... Oh Cap, she's such a wonderful girl - helps me with my
			letters because she can spell all the German names and is terribly good at punctuation ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I don't care if she can sing 'I May Be A Tiny Chimney Sweep, But I've Got An Enormous Brush'. Come
			on, Baldrick - the only thing we're going to get for free round here is dysentry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			(<i>Whispering</i>) I haven't given Lieutenant George my bunch of flowers yet.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right, hurry up, hurry up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Here you are, sir. I got you these. (<i>He holds out a bunch of dead stalks</i>) Unfortunately they've
			had their heads shot off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Where others choose to say it with flowers, Baldrick says it with stalks.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Nurse Mary returns.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			I'm afraid you'll have to leave us, Captain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Yes - you must report to General Melchett immediately.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, great. Yet another tempting opportunity for suicide beckons.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, gosh, I wish I was going with you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Oh no, you must stay here, my brave hero!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Exasperated</i>) Brave hero? Nurse, I was more wounded the last time I clipped my toenails.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Take no notice of him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>In a sarcastic baby voice</i>) Yes, pay no attention to the nasty man.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			If I can't give my brave boys a kind word and a big smile, what can I give them?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, one or two ideas do suggest themselves, but ... you'd probably think they were unhygienic.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Oh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>She storms out. A bearded man with glasses, wearing a bandage on his head, limps through the doors.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Come on, Baldrick. (<i>He notices the man walking in</i>) Hullo, what's your name?
			The man replies in a thick German accent.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smith</b><br />
			My name iz Mr Smith.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, well I'm sorry you've been landed opposite such a total git, Smith. Bad enough being wounded
			without having to share a ward with banana brain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smith</b><br />
			Oh, danke schön. Ich bin ganz comfortable, old fruit.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder looks at him doubtfully, and walks out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: MELCHETT'S HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			Blackadder knocks on the door.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Enter!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters but the room appears to be completely empty.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hello? Hello!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He looks round, and wanders towards the board covered with maps. Someone is standing behind it.
			He pulls back a flap and sees Melchett's face. As he does so, Darling pounces on Blackadder, drags
			him over to the fireplace, and frisks him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			He's clean, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Baaah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Can anyone tell me what's going on?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Security, Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Security?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			'Security' isn't a dirty word, Blackadder. 'Crevice' is a dirty word, 'security' isn't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So, in the name of security, everyone who comes into the room has to have his bottom fondled by
			this drooling pervert?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Only doing my job, Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, how lucky you are then that your job is also your hobby.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			There's another dirty word - 'job'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, is there something the matter?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You're damn right there's something the matter. Something sinister, and grotesque. And what's worse
			is that it's right here under my nose!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, come now, sir, your moustache is lovely.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			What the general means, Blackadder, is there is a leak.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Now 'leak' is a positively disgusting word.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			The Germans seem to be able to anticipate our every move. We send up an aeroplane, there's a Jerry
			squadron parked behind the nearest cloud. We move troops to Boulogne, the Germans have bought the
			entire town supply of lavatory paper. In short, a German spy is giving away every one of our battle
			plans.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You look surprised, Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I certainly am, sir. I didn't realize we had any battle plans.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Of course we've got plans - how else do you think our battles are directed?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Our battles are directed, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Of course they are: directed according to the grand plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, I see. And that would be the plan to continue with total slaughter until everybody's dead
			except Field Marshal Haig and Lady Haig and their tortoise Alan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			(<i>Jumping up in alarm</i>) Great Scott! Even you know it! Bolt the doors! Hammer
			large bits of crooked wood against all the windows! This security leak is far worse than I'd imagined.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			So you see, Blackadder, Field Marshal Haig is most anxious to eliminate all German spies.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Filthy Hun weasels, fighting their dirty, underhand war!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			And fortunately, one of our spies ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Splendid fellows, brave heroes risking life and limb for Blighty ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			... has discovered that the leak is coming from the field hospital.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You think there's a German spy in the field hospital? I think you might be right there.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Good - and your job, Blackadder, is to root this spy out. How long do you think you'll need?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder checks his watch.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ooh err ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You'll have to be away from the trenches for some time.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ooh, six months.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Too bad, Blackadder, you've got three weeks.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, three weeks, Blackadder, to smoke the bugger out. Use any method you see fit - I'd personally
			recommend you get hold of a cocker spaniel, tie the suspect to a chair with a potty on his head,
			pop his todger between two floury baps and shout, 'Dinner time, Fido!' If you're successful, I'll
			want you back here permanently to head up our new security network - Operation Winkle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Winkle?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, to winkle out the spies.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			You never mentioned this to me, sir!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			We have to have some secrets, don't we, Darling.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, I'll be back in three weeks.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Excellent. And if you come back with the information, Captain Darling will pump you thoroughly
			in the debriefing room.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not while I've got my strength he won't.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Damnation, sir, his insolence makes my blood boil! And what's more, I don't trust Blackadder,
			sir. I think it would be best if I went to the hospital myself to keep an eye on him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			What, spy on our own spy as he searches for their spy? Yes - why not? Sounds rather fun! Under
			cover, of course.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Definitely, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You'll have to have a convincing wound.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Naturally, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett points the gun at Darling's foot and shoots. Darling screams and falls to the floor.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			There - that looks quite convincing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, pack me a toothbrush. We're going on holiday.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Hurray! Where to?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hospital.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh no, I hate hostipals! My grandad went into one and when he came out he was dead!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			He was also dead when he went in - he'd been run over by a traction engine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I don't like them doctors. If they start poking around inside me ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, why would anyone wish to poke around inside you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			They might find me interesting.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, I find the Great Northern and Metropolitan sewage system interesting, but that doesn't
			mean I want to put on some rubber gloves and pull things out of it with a pair of tweezers.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Still, tell you what, sir - you might have a chance to get to know that pretty nurse.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He makes what he hopes is a suggestive face. It is not.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, thank you, Baldrick - she's as wet as a fish's wet bits. I'd rather get to know you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm not available, sir. I'm waiting for Miss Right to come along and gather me up in her arms.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes - I wouldn't get too hopeful - we'd have to get her arms out of her strait jacket first. Now,
			get packing!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: THE FIELD HOSPITAL WARD</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>George is reading back another letter, this time to Mary and Smith, who is still talking in a
			thick German accent.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Smith</b><br />
			Ach, ach, so very interesting. Please, do continue, old bean.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Right, then, I go on to say, the orders came through at 0800 for us to advance in a pincer movement.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Gosh, how exciting.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes, it was.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The doors swing open for Baldrick and Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Afternoon, George.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Hullo, Cap.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Ah, Captain. I hope you're going to conduct yourself with a little more decorum this time.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, I'm going to conduct myself with no decorum. Shove off!!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			(<i>Outraged</i>) Oh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mary leaves. Blackadder motions for Smith to move away from the side of George's bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			So, Cap, what's going on?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			There's a German spy in the hospital and it's my job to find him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			A Ger ... well, snakes alive! Exciting stuff, eh? Wait a minute! I think I've got a plan already.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, look down the list of patients and see if there's anyone here whose name begins with 'von' -
			he's almost bound to be the bloke.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes - I think we may find he's using a false name actually, George.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, that's hardly fair, is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I too have a cunning plan to catch the spy, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Do you, Baldrick, do you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes. Go around the hostipal and you ask everyone, 'Are you a German spy?'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, I must say, Baldrick, I appreciate your involvement on the creative side.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			If it was me, I'd own up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course you would, but sadly the enemy have not yet added to the German army entrance form the
			requirement 'must have intellectual capacity of a boiled potato' . Now, see that man over there?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He points to Smith, who is lying in bed watching them through binoculars.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I want you to stick to him like a limpet and make sure he doesn't leave the hospital.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Darling, limping with a cane.</i><br />
			<br />
			Hello, Darling, what are you doing here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Bullet in the foot.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I can understand people up the front shooting themselves in the foot, but to do it when you're 35
			miles behind the lines ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I did not shoot myself. The general did it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Finally got fed up with you, did he?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No, it was a mistake.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Aiming for your head, was he?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			He wasn't aiming for anything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, so going for between your legs then.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Very funny, Blackadder. You'll be laughing on the other side of your face if you don't find this spy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't worry, Darling, I intend to start interviewing suspects immediately.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: THE SURGERY ROOM IN THE HOSPITAL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling is tied to a hideous home-made torture chair, with a potty on his head.
			Blackadder is sitting behind a desk.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			This is completely ridiculous, Blackadder, you can't suspect me! I've only just arrived!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The first rule of counter-espionage is to suspect everyone. Believe me, I shall be asking myself
			some pretty searching questions later. Tell me - what is the colour of the Queen of England's
			favourite hat?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			How the hell should I know?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Sinisterly</i>) I see. Then let me ask you another question. What is the name of the German
			Head of State?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Well, Kaiser Wilhelm, obviously!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So, you're on first-name terms with the Kaiser, are you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Look, what did you expect me to say?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Darling, Darling. Ssh-ssh. Cigarette?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Suddenly, he's a nice cop.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder gets up, puts a cigarette in Darling's mouth, and lights it. After a few seconds he
			snatches it away.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Shouting</i>) All right you stinking piece of crap!<br />
			<br />
			<i>And now, he's nasty.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I beg your pardon ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Really loud</i>) Shut your ugly cake hole, sonny! I know you! Tell me, von Darling, what was
			it finally won you over, eh? Was it the pumpernickel? Or was it the thought of hanging around with
			big men in leather shorts?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			(<i>Really scared</i>) I'll have you court-martialled for this, Blackadder!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			For carrying out a general's orders? That may be the way you do it in Munich, or should I say,
			München! - but not here, Werner. You are a filthy Hun spy, aren't you?! Baldrick, the cocker
			spaniel, please.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No, I'm not! I'm engaged, I was born in Croydon, I was educated at Ipplethorpe Primary School,
			I've got a girlfriend called Doris and I know the words of all three verses of 'God Save the King'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Four verses.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Four verses! Four verses! For God's sake, I'm as British as Queen Victoria!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You mean your father's German, you're half German and you married a German.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No! No! For God's sake, I'm not a German spy!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Now Darling is crying. And suddenly Blackadder is totally quiet and casual and pleasant.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good, thanks very much. Send in the next man, would you?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mary bursts in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			What is all this noise about? Don't you realize this is a hospital!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			You'll regret this, Blackadder! You'd better find the real spy or I'll make it very hard for you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Please, Darling - there are ladies present.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling storms out still tied to the chair. There is a loud crash and a cry from outside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Well, well, Captain Blackadder - this is an unexpected pleasure.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mary is suddenly changed - practical and frank and not the slightest bit sissy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Nice to have you back with us. A spy catcher eh? That silly kid George was right. You are a bally hero.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Wait a minute. I thought you liked George.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			No - it's just my bedside manner. What I call my fluffy bunny act.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So, you're not a drip after all?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Oh, no. So, Mr Spy Catcher, how's it going?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, not much luck so far. I think the spy might be as difficult to find as a piece of hay in
			a massive stackful of needles.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			So, you're going to be around for awhile then.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes - looks like it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She undoes her cap.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Good. It can get pretty lonely round here, you know. God, it's nice to have someone healthy
			to talk to ... cigarette?<br />
			<br />
			<i>This is flirting with a capital 'F'.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, thank you. I only smoke cigarettes after making love. So, back in England I'm a 20-a-day man.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mary lights her cigarette and blows it in Blackadder's face. He blinks.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			A man should smoke. It acts as an expectorant and gives his voice a deep, gravelly, masculine tone.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			God, I love nurses. They're so disgustingly clinical.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There's definitely something in the air.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Tell me, Captain Blackadder -<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Edmund. When this war's over, do you think one day we might ... get to know each other better?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, why not? When this madness is finished, perhaps we could go cycling together - take a
			spin down to the Old Swan at Henley, go for a walk in the woods.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Yes. (<i>Pause</i>) Or we could just do it right now on the desk.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is unfazed. He looks at the desk.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, okay.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: THE FIELD HOSPITAL WARD</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A few days later. Smith enters, closely followed by Baldrick. George is writing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Hello, Baldrick. Have you seen Nurse Mary? I need someone to post this letter.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			She's in her office with the captain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Poor girl. Tied to her desk day and night.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Blackadder, breezy and confident.</i><br />
			<br />
			Hello, Cap. I hear you've been seeing a lot of Nurse Mary.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, almost all of her, in fact.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			How is she, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Unbelievable.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Cap, Cap, what I really want to know, sir, is are you any closer to the spy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh. I think I'm getting there. Everything all right, Smith?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Smith is now in bed, with Baldrick sitting up next to him reading a magazine.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Smith</b><br />
			Excellent, jawohl, excellent.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Jolly good.<br />
			<br />
			<i>No sooner arrived, when he's off again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Smithy, you haven't seen any suspicious-looking characters who might be German spies?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smith</b><br />
			Nein.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Amazed</i>) Nine? The Cap's got his work cut out then.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE SURGERY ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Mary are lying together in the surgery bed, both smoking cigarettes.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Tell me, Edmund, do you have someone special in your life?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, yes, I do, as a matter of fact.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Who?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			No, someone you love and cherish and want to keep safe from all the horror and the hurt?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Still me, really.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			No, but back home in England, there must be someone waiting, some sweetheart?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, a girl! Nah! You see, I've always been a soldier, married to the army - the book of King's
			Regulations is my mistress, possibly with a Harrods lingerie catalogue discreetly tucked between
			its pages.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			And no casual girlfriends?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Skirt? Ha! If only. When I joined up we were still fighting colonial wars: if you saw someone
			in a skirt you shot him and nicked his country. What about you?
			Have you got a man? Some fine fellow in an English country village? A vicar
			maybe? Quiet, gentle, hung like a baboon.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			There was a man, I cared for a little. Wonderful chap, strong, athletic.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what happened to him?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			He bought it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder gets up and looks for his wallet.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm so sorry, I didn't realize that was the arrangement. What's it been - let's say twelve
			nights, and what, nine afternoons and a couple of mornings ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			I mean, he died.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, I'm sorry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			He was test driving one of those new tank contraptions and the bloody thing blew up. What a
			waste. God, I hope they've scrapped the lot.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Fat chance. They're going to use forty of them next week - whoops, sorry - I
			musn't talk about it. You never know who might be listening.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Oh, no, of course. Oh, God, I miss him so much - he was such a wonderful chap.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Clever too, I expect.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Yes, brilliant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			One of the great universities I suppose - Oxford, Cambridge, Hull.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Yes. But why are we making small talk when we could be making big love?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good point. This could be the last time. My three weeks are up. I'm going back to Staff HQ
			tomorrow. Look, why don't you come and have supper or something?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			How about something first, then supper?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good idea.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: MELCHETT'S HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Mary are seated in front of the fire. Melchett enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Ah, hullo, Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Morning, sir. May I introduce Nurse Fletcher-Brown - she's been very supportive during my
			work at the hospital.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			How do you do, young lady. Sit down. Tell me, Blackadder, any news about our spy yet?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Excellent - the Germans seem to know every move we make. I had a letter from Jerry yesterday.
			It said 'isn't it about time you changed your shirt, Walrus-Face?' Tell me, have you got any
			ideas who it might be, my dear?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Well, sir, I'm only a humble nurse, but I did think at one point that it might be Captain Darling.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, bugger me with a fish-fork! Old Darling a Jerry morse-tapper! What made you suspect him?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Well, sir, he pooh-poohed the Captain here, sir, and said he'd never find the spy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Is this true, Blackadder? Did Darling pooh-pooh you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, perhaps a little.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Then dammit all - what more evidence do you need? The pooh-poohing alone is a court martial offence!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I assure you, sir, the pooh-pooh was purely circumstantial.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I hope so Blackadder - if there's one thing I've learnt in the army, it's never ignore a pooh-pooh!
			I knew a major got pooh-poohed, and made the mistake of ignoring the pooh-pooh. He pooh-poohed it!
			Fatal error! Because it turned out the soldier who'd pooh-poohed him had been pooh-poohing a lot
			of other officers who'd also pooh-poohed their pooh-poohs. In the end we had to disband the
			regiment - morale totally destroyed by pooh-pooh.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, I think we're rather drifting slightly from the point here, sir, which is unfortunately,
			and to my lasting regret, Captain Darling is not the spy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, well, who the hell is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Well, sir, there is a man in the hospital with a pronounced limp and a very strong German
			accent. It must be him - it's obvious.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Obvious, but wrong, it's not him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			And why not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Because, sir, not even the Germans would be stupid enough to field a spy with a strong German accent.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Well, who is it then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, it's perfectly simple. (<i>He turns to Mary</i>) It's you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mary leaps up and away from Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Edmund!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters and holds a rifle to Nurse Mary.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Explain yourself, Blackadder - before I have you shot for being rude to a lady.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, sir, the first seeds of suspicion were sown when Lieutenant George unwittingly revealed
			that she spoke German ... Do you deny Nurse Fletcher-Brown - or should I say Nurse Fleischer-Baum -
			that you helped George out with the difficult German words in his letters?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			No, I did, but ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My suspicions were confirmed when she probed me expertly about tank movements.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Edmund, how could you? After all we've been through!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And then the final irrefutable proof. Remember you mentioned a clever boyfriend.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I leapt on the opportunity to test you. I asked you whether he had been to one of the
			great universities, Oxford, Cambridge, Hull.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Well?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What you didn't spot is that only two of those are great universities.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			You swine!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			That's right. Oxford's a complete dump!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, quite, no true Englishwoman would have fallen into that trap.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mary</b><br />
			Oh, Edmund - I thought there was something beautiful between us - I thought you ... loved me.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Pause. They stare and stare at each other and then ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Nah. Baldrick! Take her away!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Certainly, sir. Raus! Raus!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They exit, traitor and troglodyte.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Good work, Blackadder. I'd better ring for a firing squad.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder stands by as Melchett sits down at the desk to use the phone when Smith enters
			and approaches Melchett, unseen. Then suddenly Darling enters behind Smith and pounces on him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Watch out, sir!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He attacks Smith, who he thinks is about to assassinate the general. After a brief struggle:</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Darling! What on earth do you think you're doing?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I'll tell you exactly what I'm doing, sir - I'm doing what Blackadder should have done three weeks ago!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling points a gun at Smith.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			This is the guilty man.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Darling, you 're getting hysterical.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I'm not, sir. Ask him outright. Are you a spy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smith</b><br />
			Jawohl, I em a spy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			You see, sir!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Of course he's a spy, Darling. A British spy! He 's Brigadier Sir Bernard Proudfoot-Smith -
			the finest spy in the British army.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			But he can't be, sir. Listen to him, he doesn't even sound British.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smith</b><br />
			Unfortunately, I hef been under cover in Chermany so long, I've picked up a teensy weensy bit
			of an accent.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			This, Darling, is the man who told us there was a German spy in the hospital in the first
			place. Well, that's that then - Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You are now Head of Operation Winkle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Darling?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Yes, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You are a complete arse.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Thank you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Come on, Bernard. Let's go and watch the firing squad.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Smith</b><br />
			Jawohl!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They exit just as George enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Sir, what the devil is going on? I've just seen the lovely Nurse Mary being led away to a firing squad.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Nurse Mary is the spy, George.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			What? Impossible!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			'Fraid so.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, cover me with eggs and flour and bake me for forty minutes. Who'd have thought it! Nurse
			Mary - a Boche nose poker inner? Still, pretty exciting stuff to put in my next letter to my
			Uncle Herman in Munich.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sorry?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			The letters I've been writing in hospital to my German uncle.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder looks worried.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			New information, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, I know there's a war on, but family is family ... and old Uncle Hermie does so love to be
			kept abreast of what's going on. I even wrote and told him about old Walrus-Face Melchett and
			his smelly old shirts!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			(<i>Very smugly</i>) Would you like me to tell this one to the general, Blackadder - or would
			you enjoy that very special moment?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder turns and runs out followed by Darling.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>There is probably trouble in store. As for Nurse Mary, we can only hope the firing squad
			was stopped in time. Rumour has it that Baldrick was delegated to give them the message.</i>
