			<b>SCENE ONE: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>George is sitting on the table oiling a cricket bat and whistling irritatingly. Blackadder
			is lying on his bed getting irritated. Blackadder does a big sigh.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Are you a little bit cheesed off, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			George, the day this war began I was cheesed off. Within ten minutes of you turning up, I had
			finished the cheese and moved on to the coffee and cigars, and at this late stage I am in a cab
			with two lady companions on my way to the Pink Pussycat in Lower Regent Street.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Because if you are cheesed off, sir, you know what'd cheer you up? A Charlie Chaplin film! Oh,
			I love old Chappers, don't you, Cap?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Unfortunately, no, I don't. I find his films about as funny as getting an arrow
			through the neck and then discovering there's a gas bill tied to it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, beg pardon, sir, but come off! His films are ball-bouncingly funny.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Rubbish.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			All right, well-let's consult the men for a casting vote, shall we? Baldrick!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Charlie Chaplin, Baldrick. What do you make of him?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, sir, he's as funny as a vegetable that has grown into a rude and amusing shape, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So you agree with me - not at all funny.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, come on skipper, play fair. In that last film of his, when he kicked that fellow in the
			backside, I thought I'd die.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, if that's your idea of comedy, we can provide our own without expending a ha'penny for
			the privilege.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He chucks Baldrick's cap to the ground. As Baldrick bends to pick it up, Blackadder kicks
			Baldrick in the pants.</i><br />
			<br />
			There, did you find that funny?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, of course not, sir. You see, Chaplin is a genius.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			He certainly is a genius, George. He invented a way of getting paid a million dollars a year
			for wearing a pair of stupid trousers. Did you find that funny, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What funny, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder chucks Baldrick's hat on the floor again. Baldrick bends and Blackadder kicks
			him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That funny.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, sir. And you mustn't do that to me, sir. Because that is a bourgeois act of repression,
			sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Now this is something new.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Haven't you smelt it, sir? There's something afoot in the wind. The huddled masses yearning to
			be free.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, have you been at the diesel oil again?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, sir, I have been supping the milk of  freedom. Already our Russian comrades are poised on
			the brink of revolution and here too, sir, the huddled wossnames, such as myself, sir, are ready
			to throw off the hated oppressors like you and the lieutenant ... present company excepted, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Go and clean out the latrines.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir, right away, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			The reason why Chaplin is funny is because he's part of the great British music-hall tradition.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, yes. The great British music-hall tradition. Two men with incredibly unconvincing Cockney
			accents going: 'What's up with you then? What's up with me then? Yeh, what's up with you then?
			What's up with me then? I'll tell you what's up with me then. I'm right browned off, that's what's
			up with me. Right browned off? Yes, right browned off.' Get on with it!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Now, sir, that was funny. You should go on the boards yourself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you, George, but if you don't mind, I'd rather have my tongue beaten wafer-thin with a
			steak-tenderizer and then stapled to the floor with a croquet hoop.<br />
			<br />
			<i>From the trenches outside comes a loud cheer. Baldrick enters with a bucket and newspaper.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Sir, sir, it's all over the trenches.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well mop it up then.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He gives the newspaper to Blackadder, who sits on the bed to read it.</i><br />
			<br />
			The news. The Russian Revolution has started. The masses have risen up and shot all their nobs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is engrossed in the paper.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, no, the bloody Russians have pulled out of the war.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, we soon saw them off, didn't we, sir? Miserable, slant-eyed, sausage eating swine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The Russians are on our side, George.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, are they, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And they have abandoned the Eastern front.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is heading back to the celebrations.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			And they've overthrown Nicholas the Second who used to be bizarre.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Who used to be the Czar, Baldrick. The point is that now the Russians have made peace with the
			Kaiser, at this very moment over three-quarters of a million Germans are leaving the Russian Front
			and coming over here with the express purpose of using my nipples for target practice. There's only
			one thing for it, I'm going to have to desert. And I'm going to do it right now.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder reaches for his coat and is about to exit as Melchett comes through the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Leaving us, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, I'm relieved to hear it because I need you to help me shoot some deserters later on. There
			have been subversive mutterings amongst the men. You'll recall the French army last year at Verdun,
			where the top echelons suffered horrendous uprisings from the bottom?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir, but surely that was traced to a shipment of garlic éclairs?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Nonsense, Blackadder, it was bolshiness, plain bolshiness, and now that the
			Huskies have followed suit, I'm damned if I'm going to let the same thing happen here.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what are you going to do about it, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			We're going to have a concert party to boost the men's morale.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			A concert party! Well, hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You fancy an evening at a concert party, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, frankly, sir, I'd rather spend an evening on top of a stepladder in No
			Man's Land smoking endless cigarettes through a luminous balaclava.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Didn't think it would bf quite your cup of tea, but I do need someone to help me organize it, you
			know. Obviously not a tough, grizzled soldier like yourself but some kind of damp-eyed nancy-boy
			who'd be prepared to spend the rest of the war in the London Palladium.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, the show's going to the London Palladium, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, of course. It's no good crushing the revolution over here only to get back home to Blighty and
			find that everybody's wearing overalls and breaking wind in the palaces of the mighty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good point, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Now, the thing is, Blackadder, finding a man to organize a concert party is going to be damn difficult.
			So, I've come up with a rather cunning set of questions with which to test a candidate's suitability
			for the job.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what sort of questions would these be, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, the first question is: do you like Charlie Chaplin?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder turns to George.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Dismissed, Lieutenant.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George salutes and leaves ...</i><br />
			<br />
			Do you like Charlie Chaplin? Yes, that is a good question for a candidate. To which my answer would,
			of course, be, yes, I love him. Love him, sir. Particularly the amusing kicks.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>At door</i>) That's funny, sir, because I thought you said ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Goodbye, George.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			And the second question is: do you like music hall?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, yes, another good question, sir. Again my answer would have to be, yes, absolutely love it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He grabs hold of his lapels and starts to sing.</i><br />
			<br />
			'Oops, Mr Rothschild,<br />
			'ows yer apples and pears!'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, you see, it's my view, Blackadder, that the kind of person who answered yes to both of those
			questions would be ideal for the job ... wait a minute!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Smugly</i>) What, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett laughs.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Why - without knowing it, Blackadder, you've inadvertently shown me that you could do the job.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Have I, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, sir! You have, sir! And I want you to start work straight away. A couple of shows over the
			weekend and, if all goes well, we'll start you off in London, well, next Monday.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, damn.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Now, in case you need any help fetching and carrying backstage and so on, I'll lend you my driver,
			if you like. (<i>He calls out</i>) Bob!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Bob, a pert and efficient young lass. She stands to attention and salutes. There is
			something pleasantly familiar about her.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Driver Parkhurst reporting for duty, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			All right, at ease, Bob, stand easy ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Captain Blackadder, this is Bob.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Bob.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Good morning, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Unusual name for a girl.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, yes, it would be an unusual name for a girl. But it's a perfectly straightforward name for a
			young chap like you, eh, Bob? Now, Bob, I want you to bunk up with Captain Blackadder for a couple
			of days, all right?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I think you'll find Bob's just the man for this job, Blackadder. He has a splendid sense of humour.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			He sir? He? He?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You see, you're laughing already. Well now, Bob, I'll leave you two together. Why don't you get to
			know each other - play a game of cribbage, have a smoke, some - thing like that. They tell me that
			Captain Blackadder has rather a good line in rough shag. I'm sure he'd be happy to fill your pipe.
			Carry on.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett leaves, satisfied with a job well done.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So, you're a chap, are you, Bob?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Oh, yes, sir. Yo ho ho. Grrr, grrr.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You wouldn't say you're a girl at all?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Definitely not, sir. I understand cricket, I fart in bed and everything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, let me put it another way, Bob. You are a girl. And you're a girl with as much talent for
			disguise as a giraffe in dark glasses trying to get into a polar-bears-only golf club.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Oh, sir, please don't give me away, sir. I just wanted to be like my brothers and
			join up. I want to see how a war is fought so badly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, you've come to the right place, Bob. A war hasn't been fought this badly since Olaf the Hairy,
			High Chief of all the Vikings, accidentally ordered 80,000 battle helmets with the horns on the inside.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			I want to do my bit for the boys, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, really.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			I'll do anything, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, I'd keep that to yourself if I was you, Bob.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The next day. Blackadder and Bob are sitting at the table with Baldrick standing by. Blackadder
			hangs up the phone. Bob has a clipboard and is taking notes.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So, Bob, the second half starts with Corporals Smith and Johnson as the Three Silly Twerps.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Right, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The big joke being there's only two of them ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I love that, that always cracks me up, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			To be followed by Baldrick's impersonation of Charlie Chaplin ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick puts on a bowler hat and pulls a Chaplin face.</i><br />
			<br />
			Bob, take a telegram.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mr C. Chaplin, Sennett Studios, Hollywood, California. 'Congrats. Stop. Have discovered only person
			in world less funny than you. Stop. Name - Baldrick. Stop. Yours E. Blackadder.' Stop. Oh, put a
			PS ... 'Please please please - stop.' And then after that we also have, ladies and gentlemen, the
			highlight of our show.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Da daaa!<br />
			<br />
			<i>George emerges in full drag.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I feel fantastic.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Gorgeous Georgina. The traditional soldiers' drag act.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You look absolutely lovely, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, you are either lying, blind or mad. The lieutenant looks as all soldiers look on these
			occasions - about as feminine as W. G. Grace. What are you going to give 'em, George?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, I thought one or two cheeky gags followed by 'She was only the ironmonger's daughter, but she
			knew a surprising amount about fish as well'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Inspired. At least you've made an effort with the dress.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George goes over to Blackadder's bed and sits.</i><br />
			<br />
			Yes, what about your costume, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm in it, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I see, so your Charlie Chaplin costume consists of that hat?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir, except that in this box I have a dead slug as a brilliant false moustache.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes it out of the box.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hmmm, yes, only quite brilliant, I fear. How, for instance, are you to attach it to your face?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, I was hoping I could persuade the slug to cling on.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, the slug is dead. If it failed to cling on to life then I see no reason why it should wish
			to cling on to your upper lip.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder loses interest and gets on with his work. George beckons Baldrick over to him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Baldrick, Baldrick, slugs are always a problem. What you've got to do is screw your face up like this,
			you see, and then you can clamp it between your nose and your upper lip.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What, like this? ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick leans back and attempts this complex manoeuvre with the slug.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes, that's it, that's it, splendid. Sir, sir, there's a visitor to see you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder looks up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good Lord - Mr Chaplin! This is indeed an honour. Why, it calls for some sort of celebration.
			Baldrick! Baldrick!<br />
			<br />
			<i>George is doubled over with laughter.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Sir, that's extraordinary! Because, you see, this isn't Chaplin at all. This is Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick removes the slug and stands up straight.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes - it's me, sir!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I know, I know - I was, in fact, being sarcastic.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, I see.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Everything goes over your head, doesn't it, George. You should go to Jamaica and become a limbo
			dancer.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: WINGS OF THE THEATRE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>George is taking a bow on stage, with an, arm full of flowers. There is a roar of wild applause.
			More flowers are thrown at George. Blackadder, Bob and Baldrick are backstage.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			They love him, sir - we're a hit!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes - in one short evening, I have become the most successful impresario since the manager of the
			Roman Colosseum put the Christians and the lions on the same bill.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Sir, some people seem to think I was best - would you agree?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick - in the Amazonian rain forests there are tribes of Indians as yet untouched by civilization
			who have developed more convincing Charlie Chaplin impressions than yours.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, thank you very much, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			He's coming off.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The stage curtains open and George backs through them. They are drawn in front of him. The
			audience are still cheering.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			What do you think, Bob? One more? God, I love the theatre.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Bob opens the curtains once more and George takes another bow before stepping backstage once
			more.</i><br />
			<br />
			It's in my blood and in my soul. Baldrick, put those in some water, would you?<br />
			<br />
			<i>George throws flowers at Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick puts the flowers upside down in the fire bucket hanging on the wall.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I need that applause in just the same way that an ostler needs his ... ostle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Well done, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, no - really, I was hopeless, wasn't I? Tell me honestly, sir, because I was, wasn't I? Out with
			it, sir, I was hopeless. Now, you're trying to be nice, and that's very sweet of you, sir, but,
			please, come on, I can take it, I was hopeless.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			George, you were bloody awful.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George immediately bursts into tears.</i><br />
			<br />
			But you can't argue with the box office. Personally I thought you were the least convincing female
			impressionist since Tarzan went through Jane's handbag and ate her lipstick, but I'm clearly in a
			minority. Look out London. Here we come.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: MELCHETT'S HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			Same night, immediately after the show. Darling is at his desk.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, Captain Darling.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Ah, Captain Blackadder. I must say I had an absolutely splendid evening.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, glad you enjoyed the show.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			The show - I didn't go to the show, I had some important regimental business.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A lorry load of paperclips arrive?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Two lorry loads actually.<br />
			<br />
			<i>General Melchett enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Ah, welcome to the great director, Maestro!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You enjoyed it, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, it was mostly awful but I enjoyed the slug-balancer.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Private Baldrick, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			That's right. Slug fell off a couple of times but you can't have everything, can you? I just
			suggest a bit more practice and perhaps a little sparkly costume for the slug.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'll pass that on, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			But I do have certain other reasons for believing the show to be nothing but a triumph. Captain
			Darling has your travel arrangements: ticket to Dover, rooms at the Ritz and so forth.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder confidently reaches out for the travel folder that Darling holds.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			However, there is one small thing you might do for me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Captain Blackadder, I should esteem it a signal honour if you would allow me to escort your leading
			lady to the Regimental Ball this evening.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My leading lady?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			The fair Georgina.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, very amusing!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Do you think she'll laugh in my face - I'm too old, too crusty?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder has to accept it. This is no joke. Melchett is in love with George.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, no, it's just that as her director, I'm afraid I could not allow it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			We can always find another director who would allow it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Quite. Well, I'll see what I can do. But I must insist that she be home by midnight
			and there be no hanky-panky, sir, whatsoever.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I shall, of course, respect your wishes Blackadder, although I'm not sure you need to be quite
			so protective. I'm sure she's a girl with a great deal more spunk than most women you find.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, dear me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Later that night. George and Blackadder are standing face to face. George is still in the dress.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Absolutely not, sir! It's profoundly immoral and utterly wrong. I will not do it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We can always find another leading lady.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well ... the dress will need a clean.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Excellent! Now the important thing is that Melchett should, under no circumstances, realize that
			you're a man.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes, yes, understand that.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			In order to ensure this, there are three basic rules. One - never, I repeat never, remove your wig.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Concentrating hard</i>) All right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Second - never say anything. I'll tell him at the beginning of the evening that you're saving your
			voice for the opening night in London.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Excellent, sir. And what is the third?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The third is most important - don't get drunk and let him shag you on the verandah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: MELCHETT'S HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The atmosphere is romantic. Darling is helping Melchett get ready; he is dressed to the nines.
			The candles are lit, it is a sparkly, perfect night for a ball.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			How do I look, Darling?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Girl bait, sir. Pure bloody girl bait.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Moustache ... bushy enough?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Like a privet hedge, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Good, because I want to catch a very beautiful creature in this bush tonight.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I'm sure you'll be combing women out of your moustache for weeks, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			God, it's a spankingly beautiful world and tonight's my night ... I know exactly what I'll say to
			her - 'Darling ...'<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling leaps to attention at the mention of his name.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Yes sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			... Uhm ... I don't know, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, don't butt in.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			(<i>Confused</i>) Sorry, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			'I want to make you happy, darling.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			(<i>Slightly embarrassed</i>) Well ... that's very kind of you, sir ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Will you kindly stop interrupting! If you don't listen, how can you tell me what you think? ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He composes himself.</i><br />
			<br />
			'I want to make you happy, darling, I want to build a nest for your ten tiny toes. (<i>Darling is
			becoming very uncomfortable indeed</i>) I want to cover every inch of your gorgeous body in pepper
			and then sneeze all over you ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling can take no more.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Really sir! I must protest!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			What is the matter with you, Darling?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Well ... it's just all so sudden, sir ... I mean, the nest bit is fine but the pepper business is
			definitely out.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			How dare you tell me how I may or may not treat my beloved Georgina.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Georgina?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, I'm working on what I'm going to say to her this evening.<br />
			<br />
			<i>At last the penny drops. He is not the object of Melchett's desire.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Oh, yes, of course, thank God.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			All right?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Yes, sir, I'm listening, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Honestly, Darling, you really are the most graceless dim-witted bumpkin I've ever met.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Oh, I don't think you should say that to her, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett shakes his head in exasperation at Darling's stupidity. It is no use explaining anything
			to him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			(<i>Annoyed</i>) Ohhh ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Baldrick are in the dug-out. Its very late indeed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Where the hell is George? It's three o'clock in the morning. He should be careful wandering around
			the trench at night with nothing to protect his honour but a cricket box.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter George, in his dress, carrying a bunch of roses.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Hullo, Captain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			About time. Where the hell have you been?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, I don't know ... it's all been like a dream, my very first ball! The music, the dancing, the
			champagne, my mind's a mad whirl of half-whispered conversations with the promise of indiscretion
			ever hanging in the air.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh - did that old stoat Melchett try for a snog behind the fruit cup?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Certainly not. The general behaved like a perfect gentleman. We tired the moon with our talking
			about everything and nothing; the war, marriage, the proposed changes to the LBW rule ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Melchett isn't married, is he?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			No, no, all his life he's been waiting to meet the perfect woman ... and then, at last, tonight,
			he did.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Some poor unfortunate had old walrus face dribbling in her ear all evening, did she?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh yes, as a matter of fact in the end I did have to drape a napkin on my shoulder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			George, are you trying to tell me that you are the general's perfect woman?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, yes, I ... rather think I am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, thank God the horny old blighter didn't ask you to marry him.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George flutters coyly behind the roses he is holding.</i><br />
			<br />
			He did?<br />
			<br />
			<i>George looks coy again.</i><br />
			<br />
			Well, how did you get out of that one?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, to be honest, sir, I'm not absolutely cert that I did.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			You can't understand what it was like, sir - the candles, the music, the huge moustache - I don't
			know what came over me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You said yes?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Yes, he did.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, after all, sir, he is a general, I didn't really feel I could refuse ... he might have had
			me court-martialled.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Whereas on the other hand, of course, he's going to give you the Victoria Cross when he lifts up
			your frock on the wedding night and finds himself looking at the last turkey in the shop?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, God, sir, I know it's a mess, but he got me squiffy and then when he looked into my eyes, and
			said, 'Chipmunk, I love you', I just ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Chipmunk?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			It's his special name for me, you see, he said my nose looks just like a chipmunk's.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God. We are in serious, serious trouble here. If the general ever finds out gorgeous Georgina
			is a strapping six-footer from the rough end of the trench, it could precipitate the fastest
			execution since someone said 'This Guy Fawkes bloke, do we let him off, or what?'<br />
			<br />
			<i>The phone goes.</i><br />
			<br />
			Hullo. Yes, sir. Straight away, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hangs up and looks at George.</i><br />
			<br />
			That was your fiancée ... Chipmunk. He wants to see me at once. If I should die, think only this
			of me - I'll be back to get you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: MELCHETT'S HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters. Melchett is sitting at his desk with Darling standing close by. They are
			still in ball attire.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sir, I can explain everything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Can you, Blackadder, can you?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, no, sir, not really.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I thought not. I thought not. Who can explain the mysteries of love? I'm in love with Georgina,
			Blackadder. I'm going to marry her on Saturday and I want you to be my best man.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I don't think that would be a very good idea, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Why not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Because there's something wrong with your fiancée, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Oh, my God, she's not Welsh is she?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, sir, it's a terrible story but true. Just a few minutes ago, Georgina arrived unexpectedly
			in my trench. She was literally dancing with joy, as though something wonderful had happened to
			her ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Makes sense.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Unfortunately, she was in such a daze, she danced straight through the trench and out into No
			Man's Land. I tried to stop her, but before I could say 'Don't tread on a mine', she trod on a mine.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchetts heart snaps.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			(<i>Distraught</i>) Oh! No!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I say a mine, it was more a cluster of mines and she was blown to smithereens, and as she
			rocketed up into the air, she said something that I couldn't quite catch, sir - totally incomprehensible
			to me - something like 'Tell him his little Chipmunk will love him for ever.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Oh, howl, howl, howl.<br />
			<br />
			<i>It is a deep and tragic sound.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			That's heartbreaking, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, I am sorry, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>From which Melchett swiftly recovers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			(<i>Completely back to normal</i>) Can't be helped. Can't be helped.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Jolly bad luck, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Hey ho.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Of course, on top of everything else, with - out your leading lady, you won't be able to put
			on the show, so no show, no London Palladium.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah ... on the contrary - I was simply intending to rename it 'The Georgina/Melchett Memorial Show'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Oh, no - Georgina was the only thing that made the show come alive. Apart from her it was all awful.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Awful.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, you'll never find another girl like Georgina by tomorrow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, it's funny you should say that, sir, because I think I already have.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Who is she?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Who is she?<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a pause as pregnant as a mother of quadruplets a week after her due date.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and George are sitting at the table deep in conversation.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			So, come on, sir, who is she?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, that's the problem, isn't it! I haven't a bloody clue. The only attractive woman round
			here is carved out of stone, called Venus and is standing in a fountain in the middle of the
			town square with water coming out of her armpits.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			So, we're a bit stuck?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Bob walks in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Morning, chaps.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George and Blackadder</b><br />
			Morning, Bob.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You can say that again, George. We're in the stickiest situation since Sticky the
			Stick Insect got stuck on a sticky bun. We are in trouble.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters. He has on a hat, shawl and dress. The closest he can get to womanhood - which
			is not close.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Not any longer, sir ... May I present my cunning plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't be ridiculous, Baldrick. Can you sing? Can yon dance? Or are you offering to be sawn in half?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, I don't think those things are important in a modern marriage, sir - I offer simple home-cooking.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, our plan is to find a new leading lady for our show. What is your plan?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My plan is that I will marry General Melchett. I am the other woman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ah, well, congratulations, Baldrick. I hope you'll be very happy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I will be, sir, because when I get back from honeymoon I'll be a member of the aristocracy, and
			you will have to call me 'Milady'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What happened to your revolutionary principles, Baldrick? I thought you hated the aristocracy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm working to bring down the system from within, sir. I'm a sort of a frozen horse.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Trojan horse, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Anyway, I can't see what's so stupid about marrying into power and wealth and not having to sleep
			in a puddle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, no! It's the worst plan since Abraham Lincoln said, 'Oh, I'm sick of kicking around the
			house tonight, let's go take in a show.' For a start, General Melchett is in mourning for the
			woman of his dreams - he's unlikely to be in the mood to marry a two-legged badger wrapped in a
			curtain. Secondly, we are looking for a great entertainer and you're the worst entertainer since
			St Paul the Evangelist toured Palestine with his trampoline act. No. we'll have to find somebody
			else.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			What about Corporal Cartwright. sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Corporal Cartwright looks like an orangutan. Ive heard of the bearded lady. but the all-over-body-hair
			lady frankly just isn't on.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Willis ?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Too short.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Petheridge?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Too old.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Taplow?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Too dead. Oh. this is hopeless. There just isn't anyone.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Bob is heard singing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			'Goodbyeee, goodbyeee, wipe the tear baby dear from your eyeee ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What am I doing?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He calls out.</i><br />
			<br />
			Bob?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Bob enters. wearing nothing but a towel.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Sir, what a brilliant idea. Bob. can you think of anyone who could be our leading lady?<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: WINGS OF THE THEATRE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Bob is taking curtsies on stage, blowing kisses and holding an armful of flowers. There is
			tumultuous applause. George opens the stage curtains and Bob sweeps through them, still blowing
			kisses to the audience.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			What do you think, Bob? One more?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			No, George - always leave them hungry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Congratulations, Bob. I have to admit, I thought you were bloody marvellous.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Thank you, sir. Permission to slip into something more uncomfortable, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Permission granted.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Bob salutes and exits. Baldrick approaches holding a box.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, sir - it's going to be wonderful. Not just for me but for my little partner, Graham, doing
			our Charlie Chaplin all round the world.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick takes the slug out of the box, leans back and places it under his nose.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes - from Shaftesbury Avenue to the Cote d' Azur they'll be saying, 'I like the little black
			one, but who's that berk he's sitting on?'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm not with you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick places the slug back into the box.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course not. But don't worry - we'll have years in luxury hotels for me to explain.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes the box from Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			Now you two, get packing, get packing. The boat-train leaves at six, and we're going to be on it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Blackadder!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, Darling - everything all right?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Oh, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Got the tickets?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Oh, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling is about to hand Blackadder the tickets when Melchett is heard bellowing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Blackadder!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, hi, General. Enjoy the show?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			(<i>Very angry</i>) Don't be ridiculous. The worst evening I've ever spent in my life.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm sorry?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He backs away in fear.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Will you stand still when I'm talking to you! If by a man's works shall you know him, then
			you're a steaming pile of horse manure.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But surely, sir, the show was a triumph?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			A triumph? The Three Twerps were one twerp short again. The slug balancer seems now to be doing
			some feeble impression of Buster Keaton, and, worst of all, the crowning turd in the waterpipe,
			that revolting drag act at the end.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Drag act?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, poor Bob Parkhurst being made to look a total arse. With that thin reedy voice and the
			stupid effeminate dancing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			(<i>Very smug</i>) So, the show's cancelled, (<i>He tears up the tickets</i>) Permanently.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But what about the men's morale, sir? With the Russians out of the war and everything ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			For goodness' sake, Blackadder! Have you been living in a cave? The Americans joined the war
			yesterday.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So how is that going to improve the men's morale, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Because, you jibbering imbecile, they've brought with them the largest collection of Charlie
			Chaplin films in existence! (<i>Blackadder is unimpressed</i>) Oh, I've lost patience with you.
			Fill him in, Darling.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Yes, sir. We received a telegram this morning from Mr Chaplin himself at Sennett Studios. (<i>He
			reads from it</i>) 'Twice nightly screening of my films in trenches -excellent idea. Stop. But
			must insist E. Blackadder be projectionist. Stop. PS Don't let him ever. Stop.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, great.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No hard feelings, eh, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder has a tiny thought - and offers Darling the box with the slug in it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not at all, Darling. Care for a liquorice allsort?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Oh, thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes the slug and puts it in his mouth. His reaction to this particular taste experience
			is not recorded.</i>
