			<H1>Corporal Punishment</H1>
			<b>SCENE ONE: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is morning. Blackadder is on the phone. George is listening keenly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You'd like to book a table for three by the window for 9.30 p.m. - not too near the band - in
			the name of Ober Leutnant von Genschler? Yes, I think you might have the wrong number. Yes.
			That's all right.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hangs up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Another crossed line, eh, sir? This phone system's an absolute shambles. No wonder we haven't
			had any orders.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			On the contrary, George, we've had plenty of orders - we've had orders for six metres of Hungarian
			crushed velvet curtain material, four rock salmon and a ha'p'orth of chips, and a cab for a Mr
			Red grave picking up from No 14 Arnos Grove, ring top bell.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			We don't want those kind of orders! We want orders to death or glory. When are we going to give
			Fritz a taste of our British spunk?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			George, please. No one is more anxious to advance than I am, but until I get these communication
			problems sorted out, I'm afraid we're stuck.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The phone rings again.</i><br />
			<br />
			Captain Blackadder speaking. No, I'm afraid the line's very xxxxsahh.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He makes a very strange, dysfunctional phone sound. Darling is on the other end of the line
			in Melchett's HQ.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Hullo, hullo, Captain Blackadder? Hullo, hullo?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder rustles a newspaper into the phone and bangs it against the receiver.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Schnell! Schnell! Kartoffelkopf.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I said there's a terrible line my end! You are to advance on the enemy at once!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Now Blackadder starts blowing raspberries into the phone and then begins to sing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Pppppft ppppft pffffffft. A wandering minstrel I, a thing of ... beeoooolerum  ... gale force
			eight imminent.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And hangs up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, so come on, sir, what's the message? Do tell. I'm on tenterhooks!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			As far as I can tell, the message was he's got a terrible lion up his end so there's an advantage
			to an enema at once.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, damn.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Message from HQ, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hands George a telegram and then exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ah - this will be it - a telegram ordering an advance.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mmm. I'm afraid not, George. It is a telegram, it is ordering an advance - but unfortunately it
			seems to be addressed to someone called Catpain Blackudder. Do you know a Catpain Blackudder,
			George?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Rings a bell, sir, but no.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, me neither.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He screws up the telegram and throws it away.</i><br />
			<br />
			Don't worry, George - I'm sure if they really want to contact us they'll find a way. Baldrick
			rushes in, shouting.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Pigeon, sir! Pigeon! There's a pigeon in our trench.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He exits again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ah, now, this'll be it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They leave the dug-out and see a large pigeon at the top of the trench.</i><br />
			<br />
			Bravo - it's one of the King's Carrier Pigeons!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No it isn't - that pigeon couldn't carry the king. It hasn't got a tray or anything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Lieutenant, revolver, please.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder takes George's gun.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, no, sir - you really shouldn't do this, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, come on. With 50,000 men getting killed a week, who's going to miss a pigeon?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder shoots the pigeon. Feathers fly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, not you, obviously, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			In any case, it's scarcely a court-martial offence. Get plucking, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			All right, sir. Oh look, there's a little ring round its leg. There's a novelty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, really? Has it got a paper hat as well?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, but there's a joke; read it out, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, it's a bit charred but ... 'something, something at once. P.S. Due to communication
			crisis - the shooting of pigeons is now a court-martial offence.' I don't see what's funny
			about that, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's not funny, it's deadly serious. We're in trouble - so I shall eat the evidence for lunch.
			And if anyone asks you any questions at all, we didn't receive any messages, and we definitely
			did not shoot this delicious plump-breasted pigeon.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder has just finished eating the pigeon.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mmm. Delicious.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Suddenly from outside ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Blackadder!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Ten Shun!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Baldrick stand to attention. Melchett and Darling sweep in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			And why, Captain, are you not advancing across No Man's Land?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, well, General - call me a bluff old traditionalist, but I was always taught to wait for the
			order to attack before attacking.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You mean you haven't had your orders to advance? What the hell are you playing at, Darling?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			This is a blatant lie, sir. I spoke to Captain Blackadder less than an hour ago.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, you did. To tell me some gobbledegook about having a lion up your bottom.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Hmmmmm. As I thought, it's the old communications problem again. Stand easy. Action on this is
			imperative. Take that down, Darling.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling unwillingly takes it down in his notebook.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			And make a note of that word 'gobbledegook' - I like it. I want to use it more often in conversation.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Yes, sir. I must say, sir, I find all this very unlikely. Not only did I telephone Captain
			Blackadder, but, as you'll recall, we sent him a telegram and a carrier pigeon.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Amazed</i>) Did you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Are you telling us you haven't had a pigeon, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder eyes his plate nervously.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Er ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He deftly pulls a napkin over the carcass.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You must have done. I sent our top bird: Speckled Jim. My own true love, who's been with me
			since I was a nipper.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He swiftly returns to business matters ...</i><br />
			<br />
			To business. I'm giving you your orders to advance now. Synchronize watches, gentlemen. Private,
			what time is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			We didn't receive any messages, and Captain Blackadder definitely did not shoot this delicious
			plump-breasted pigeon, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett roars back at him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Do you want to be cremated, Baldrick, or buried at sea?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Ummmmmrn ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>At which moment George enters, humming.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Ah, Lieutenant - do you mind answering a couple of questions?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Not at all, sir. (<i>Reciting</i>) We didn't receive any messages and Captain Blackadder definitely
			did not shoot this delicious plump-breasted pigeon.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thanks, George.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			And look, pigeon feathers! White feathers - very apt, eh, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett takes the feathers Darling has found and examines them.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			White feathers?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, no, sir, that's gobble a duke! Well, they're not white - they're sort of speckly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Speckly! Ahhhhh! You shot my Speckled Jim?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			You're for it now, Blackadder. (<i>To Melchett</i>) Quite frankly I've suspected this for some
			time, sir. Captain Blackadder has clearly been disobeying orders with a breathtaking impertinence.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I don't care if he's been rogering the Duke of York with a prize-winning leek. He shot my pigeon!
			Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling holds back Melchett, who has gone mad and is trying to whip Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Easy, sir, easy. I think we should do this by the book, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, you're right. I'm sorry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Dug-out, Ten Shun! Captain Blackadder, as of this moment you are to consider yourself under arrest.
			Do you know what the penalty for disobeying orders is?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Court martial, followed by immediate cessation of chocolate rations?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No - court martial, followed by immediate death by firing squad.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, so I got it half right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: A CELL IN A MILITARY PRISON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A small cell, bars on the window. Blackadder sits reading. Perkins the jailer enters. He is a
			really friendly love.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			All settled in and happy, are we then, sir? Written all our goodbyes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, no need for that, Perkins. I've just dashed off a couple of notes, one asking for a sponge bag
			and the other sending for my lawyer.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			Oh, your lawyer - don't you think that might be a bit of a waste of money, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not when he's the finest mind in English legal history. Ever heard of Bob Massingbird?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			Oh, yes, indeed, sir. He's a very gifted gentleman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well quite. I remember Massingbird's most famous case - the Case of the Bloody Knife. A man was
			found next to a murdered body. He had the knife in his hand, thirteen witnesses had seen him stab
			the victim and when the police picked him up he said to them, 'I'm glad I killed the bastard.'
			Massingbird not only got him acquitted he got him knighted in the New Year's Honour's list and the
			relatives of the victim had to pay to have the blood washed out of his jacket.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			I hear he's a dab hand at prosecution as well.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Quite. Look what he did to Oscar Wilde.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			Old 'Butch' Oscar.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Exactly - big, bearded, bonking, butch Oscar, the terror of the ladies. A hundred and fourteen
			illegitimate children, world heavyweight boxing champion and author of the best selling pamphlet
			'Why I Like to Do It with Girls' - and Massingbird had him sent down for being a whoopsy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a knock at the door - Perkins goes to answer. Baldrick enters and Perkins leaves.</i><br />
			<br />
			Baldrick, anything from Bob Massingbird yet?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir, just arrived, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			A sponge bag.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A sponge bag?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, I gave you two notes. You sent the note asking for a sponge bag to the finest mind in
			English history?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Certainly did, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And you sent the note requesting legal representation to ... <i>George enters</i>.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, tally ho! With a bing and a bong and a buzz buzz buzz!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			May I say first of all, sir, that I am deeply, deeply honoured.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, I'll deal with you later. Am I to understand, George, that you are going to represent
			me at the court martial?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick leaves before this important briefing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Absolutely, family tradition actually. My uncle's a lawyer, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Your uncle's a lawyer ... but you're not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh good Lord, no! I'm a complete duffer at this sort of thing. In the School Debating Society I
			was voted 'boy least likely to complete a coherent ...' erm ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sentence?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes. Anyway, my dear old friend - it's an honour to serve.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			George, I'm in deep trouble here. I need to construct a case that's as water-tight as a mermaid's
			brassiere. I'm not sure your particular brand of mindless optimism will contribute much to the
			proceedings.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh ... that's a shame, sir, because I was hoping to play the mindless optimism card pretty strongly
			during the trial.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I beg your pardon?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes, I've already planned my closing address based on that very theme ... (<i>He takes out paper and
			grandly prepares to read</i>) 'Oh go on let him off, go on please, your honour. After all, it's a
			lovely day, pretty clouds, trees, birds etc. I rest my case.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So, Counsel, with that summing up in mind, what are my chances, do you think?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, not good I'm afraid. As far as I can see from the evidence, you're as guilty as a puppy sitting
			beside a pile of poo.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Charming.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: MELCHETT'S HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett's chamber has been transformed into a court of law. A clerk of the court is getting the
			judge's papers ready. Blackadder is standing between two guards. George charges in after him, in a
			wig and gown. He rushes forward to speak.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Crikey, so sorry I'm late, m'lord. Anyway, let me open my defence straight away by saying I've known
			this man for three years, he's an absolutely corking chap ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			George.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's the clerk of the court.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We haven't started yet.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Good luck, Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you, Darling. What's your big job today? Straightening chairs?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No - in fact, I'm appearing for the prosecution. (<i>He puts on a wig</i>) I wouldn't raise your
			hopes - you're guilty as hell. You haven't got a chance.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Why, thank you, Darling, and I hope your mother dies in a freak yachting accident.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Just doing my job, Blackadder, obeying orders. And, of course, having enormous fun into the bargain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I wouldn't be too confident if I were you - any reasonable impartial judge is bound to let me off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Well, absolutely.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Who is the judge by the way?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett's familiar 'barp' sounds from outside.</i><br />
			<br />
			I'm dead.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And Melchett enters, judge and jury.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Come on. Get this over with in five minutes, and we can have a spot of lunch. The court is now in
			session, Sir Anthony Cecil Hogmanay Melchett in the chair. The case before us is that of the Crown
			versus Captain Edmund Blackadder, alias the Flanders Pigeon Murderer. Oh, and hand me the black cap,
			will you - I'll be needing that.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I love a fair trial.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Anything to say before we kick off, Captain Darling?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			May it please the court, there is. As this is an open and shut case, I beg leave to bring a private
			prosecution against the defence counsel for wasting the court's time.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Granted! The defence counsel is fined £50 for turning up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>To Blackadder</i>) This is fun! Just like a real court.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Let the trial begin. The charge before us is that the Flanders Pigeon Murderer did deliberately,
			callously and with beastliness aforethought murder a lovely innocent pigeon ... and disobeyed some
			orders as well - is that true?<br />
			<br />
			<i>George springs to his feet.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Perfectly true, sir - I was there.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thanks, George.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He suddenly realizes his mistake.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Damn! Dammit!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Right. Counsel for the defence, get on with it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George gets up hurriedly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ah. Oh. Yes, right. I'd like to call my first witness. Captain Darling.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You wish to call the counsel for the prosecution as a defence witness?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			That's right. (<i>He whispers to Blackadder</i>) Don't worry, sir - I've got it all under control.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is sceptical. Darling takes the stand.</i><br />
			<br />
			You are Captain Darling of the General Staff?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I am.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George makes a thumbs-up gesture to Blackadder - so far, so good!</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Captain - leaving aside the incident in question, would you think of Captain Blackadder as the sort
			of man who would usually ignore orders?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Yes, I would.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ah. (<i>Pause</i>) Are you sure? I was rather banking on you saying no there.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I'm sure. I've actually got a list of other occasions he disobeyed orders, if it would be useful.
			(<i>He pulls out a notebook</i>) May 16th, 9.15 a.m., 10.23 a.m., 10.24 a.m., 11.17 a.m.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Reading the list with him</i>) You've missed one out there.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			10.30 a.m. Thank you. 11.46 a.m. ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			George.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ah, oh, yes. Thank you, Captain, no further questions.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling leaves the stand.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well done, George, you really had him on the ropes there.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes, but don't worry old man, I have a last, and I think you will find decisive, witness. Call
			Private Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guard</b><br />
			Call Private Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Baldrick. Blackadder is not hopeful and whispers to him as he passes.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Deny everything, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick goes into the dock.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Are you Private Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			But you are Captain Blackadder's batman?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is now in despair. He bangs his head on the desk in front.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, come on, Baldrick - be a bit more helpful, it's me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, it isn't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Sir, I must protest.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Quite right. We don't want your kind here, get out. George, sum up please.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ahmm, yes. (<i>He gathers himself for the grand summary</i>) Sir. Ahmm ... ahmm ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder hands him a piece of paper. George begins to read it.</i><br />
			<br />
			Sir. You have heard all the evidence presented before you today, but in the end, it is up to
			the conscience of your hearts to decide. And I firmly believe that, like me, you will conclude
			that Captain Blackadder is, in fact, totally and utterly guilty.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He sits down pleased with himself Blackadder politely turns over the piece of paper to show
			George the other side. George stands up again.</i><br />
			<br />
			... of nothing more than trying to do his duty under difficult circumstances.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Nonsense. He's a hound and a rotter and he's going to be shot. However, before I proceed to the
			formality of sentencing the deceased - I mean, defendant (<i>he laughs at this excellent joke</i>)
			- I think we'll enjoy hearing the case for the prosecution ... Captain Darling, if you please.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling clears his throat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Sir - my case is very simple. I call my first witness. General Sir Anthony Cecil Hogmanay Melchett.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Ah, excellent.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Thrilled</i>) Clever! Clever!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			General - did you own a lovely, plump, speckly pigeon called Speckled Jim which you hand-reared
			from a chick and which was your only childhood friend?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett, now in the witness stand, is very moved.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes! Yes, I did.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Did Captain Blackadder shoot the afore-mentioned pigeon?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett is very moved and very angry.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes! He did.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Can you see Captain Blackadder in this courtroom?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes! Yes! That's him. That's the man there! Ahh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He screams and points.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No further questions, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett recovers instantly and goes back to his judicial seat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Splendid. First class. Very good. I therefore have absolutely no hesitation in announcing that
			the sentence of this court is that you, Captain Edmund Blackadder, be taken from this place and
			suffer death by shooting at dawn. Do you have anything to say?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Pause.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, could I have an alarm call, please?<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: THE CELL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is lying on his bed. Perkins, the guard, enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			Chappy to see you, Captain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What does he look like?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			Short, ugly ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hullo, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters just after Blackadder says his name. He is carrying a sack. He is also talking
			in a rather odd, staccato manner.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I've brought you some food, sir: for your final breakfast tomorrow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You're not putting much hope on a last-minute reprieve then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, sir, you're as dead as some doo-doos.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The expression, Baldrick, is 'as a dodo'. Dead as a dodo.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			I'll leave you to it then, shall I?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Perkins leaves.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Do not despair, sir. All my talk of food was only a dead herring. In fact, I have a cunning plan.
			(<i>He holds up the bag</i>) This is not food! It's an escape kit!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good lord. With a saw, a hammer, a chisel, a gun, a change of clothes, a Swiss passport and a huge
			false moustache, I may just stand a chance.<br />
			<br />
			<i>This throws Baldrick slightly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now, let's see. What have we here?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He reaches into the bag and takes out a little object. A small painted wooden duck.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes - I thought if you get caught near water, you could balance it on the top of your head as a
			brilliant disguise.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, I would, of course, have to escape first. (<i>He reaches into the bag</i>) Ah, unless I'm much
			mistaken, a hammer and chisel?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You are much mistaken.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder takes out two more objects from the bag.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A pencil and a miniature trumpet?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That's right. A pencil so you can drop me a postcard saying how the break-out went and then a small,
			little, miniature, tiny trumpet in case during your escape you have to win favour with a difficult
			child.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, I'm not going to waste my last few precious hours rummaging through this feeble
			collection of stocking fillers. Let me ask you some simple questions. Is there a saw in this bag?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A hammer?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A chisel?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A gun?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A false passport?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			(<i>Thinks for a second</i>) No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A change of clothing?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir, of course, I wouldn't forget a change of clothes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, well, that's something. Let's have a look.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder takes out a little hat and a toy bow and arrow.</i><br />
			<br />
			A Robin Hood costume?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes - I put in a French peasant's outfit first, but then I thought - what if you arrive in a
			French peasant village and they're in the middle of a fancy-dress party?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what if I arrive in a French peasant village dressed in a Robin Hood costume and there isn't
			a fancy-dress party?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			To be quite frank, sir, I didn't consider that eventuality, 'cause if you did, you'd stick out
			like a ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			... a man standing in a lake with a small, painted, wooden duck on his head?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Exactly.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Perkins enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			Excuse me, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right, thank you, Baldrick, we'll finish this picnic later.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yum, yum.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He leaves.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			Mind if I disturb you for a moment, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, no - go ahead - my diary's pretty empty this week. 'Thursday morning - get shot.' That's just
			about it actually.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			Oh, good - there's a few fellows out here would like a bit of a chin wag.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, lovely - always keen to meet new people.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Perkins brings in a miscellaneous bunch of pleasant-looking Tommies.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			This is Sergeant Jones, and Privates Robinson, Fraser and Tipplewick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder shakes hands with them all.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah. Nice of you to drop by. (<i>Pause</i>) And what do you do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			We're your firings quad, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course you are.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Private Robinson</b><br />
			Good size chest.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He's inspecting Blackadder professionally.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			Shut up, lad.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Private Robinson</b><br />
			Sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			You see, us firing squads are like taxmen really. Everybody hates us, but we're just doing our
			job, aren't we, lads?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My heart bleeds for you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Private Robinson</b><br />
			Well sir, we aim to please. (<i>They all laugh</i>) Just a little firing squad joke there, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			You see, sir, we take pride in the terminatory service we supply, so is there any particular area
			you'd like us to go for? We can aim anywhere.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, in that case, just above my head might be a good spot.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all roar with laughter.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			Ha ha! You see, a laugh and a smile and all of a sudden the job doesn't seem quite so bad, does it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Private Tipplewick</b><br />
			(<i>Pointing</i>) Lovely roomy forehead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Private Robinson</b><br />
			Yes, good pulsing jugular there as well.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They touch Blackadder, who swats them away.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Look, I'm sorry - I know you mean to be friendly, but I hope you won't take it amiss if I ask you
			to sod off and die.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Squad</b><br />
			Ooooh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They're actually rather hurt.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			Now, now, fair enough. Of course not, sir. No one likes being shot first thing in the morning, do
			they, lads?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Squad</b><br />
			True. Course not. No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			Look forward to seeing you again tomorrow. You'll have the blindfold on, but, you'll recognize me.
			I'm the one who says, 'Ready, Aim, Fire!'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Could I ask you to leave a pause just before the word 'aim' and the word 'fire' - thirty or forty
			years perhaps?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The lads fall about laughing again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			Ooh, I just wish I could pause, I really wish I could, sir, but I can't. I'm a gabbler, me ...
			(<i>He says quickly</i>) 'Ready – aim - fire!' No style, no finesse, but it gets the job done, eh,
			boys? Come along, boys, let's go.<br />
			<br />
			<i>On the way out they are heard talking between themselves.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Private Tipplewick</b><br />
			Whoever gets closest to the mole gets to keep his gold teeth.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Private Robinson</b><br />
			Sleep well, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is left alone.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Goodnight. Perfect! I wonder if anything on earth could depress me more?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Re-enter Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Excuse me, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And of course it could.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Sorry - I forgot to give you this letter from Lieutenant George, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, joy. What wise words then from the world's greatest defence counsel? 'Dear Mother ... thanks
			for the case of scotch', ... hmmm, unusual start. You've excelled yourself, Baldrick - the wrong
			letter again.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Come to think of it, he did write two.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes - his mother is about to receive a note telling her he's sorry she's going to be shot in the
			morning: and I have to read this drivel. (<i>He reads on</i>) 'Hope that Celia thrives in the Pony
			Club Trials and Freddy scores a century for the first eleven.' You can't deny it's a riveting read
			... 'And send my love to Uncle Rupert - who'd have thought it? Mad Uncle Rupe - Minister of War
			with power of life and death over every bally soldier in the army.' That's it! All George has to
			do is send him a telegram and he'll get me off. Baldrick, I love you! I want to kiss your cherry
			lips and nibble your shell-like ears. I'm free!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick puckers up. He's game.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>George is in a very quiet mood.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, I'm useless, useless.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Sir, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ah, hullo, Baldrick. How is the ... captain?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, he's absolutely fine, sir, but ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			You're just trying to cheer me up, Baldrick, but I know the truth. He hates me because I
			completely arsed up his defence.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir, but ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I'm thick. I'm as thick as the big print version of the Complete Works of Charles Dickens.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I know, sir, but ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			If only I could have saved him, if only ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But you can, sir!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			What? How?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You send a telegram!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes of course! I send a telegram! Who to?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			The person who was in your letter.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			What letter?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			To your mother.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I send a telegram to my mother!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			No!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You send a telegram to the person in the letter to your mother.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Who was in the letter to my mother?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I can't remember, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well think, think.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, you think think!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Celia! The Pony Club Trials! Yes! Celia could leap over the walls of the prison and get the
			captain out.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, no, no.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			No, no, no. (<i>He spots a cricket bat</i>) Cricket! Yes! Cousin Freddie! Of course! He could
			knock out the firing squad with his cricket bat!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, no, no, someone else.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Who?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I don't know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Neither do I.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Think, think.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			You think!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You think, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I'm stuck, I'm stuck.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick hits George over the head with the cricket bat.</i><br />
			<br />
			No, that hasn't helped.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick has a sudden revelation ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, it has, sir, your Uncle Rupert who has just been made Minister of War.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Of course, Uncle Rupert who has just been made Minister of War! I'll send him the telegram.
			He'll pull strings, scratch backs, fiddle with knobs and get the captain off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Hurray, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, we got there in the end.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			We did, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I think this calls for a celebration. What about some Old Moorhead's Shredded Sporran that
			Mumsie's just sent me.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He gets a whisky bottle out and pours them both a drink.</i><br />
			<br />
			A toast to Captain Blackadder and freedom.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George and Baldrick</b><br />
			Captain Blackadder and freedom!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: THE COURTYARD</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The firing squad are loading up. Enter Blackadder and Perkins. Blackadder walks on to the
			top step. He's very chipper indeed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Morning!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Squad</b><br />
			Morning, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			I must say, Captain, I've got to admire your balls.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Perhaps later.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He moves down to the squad. So, boys? How you doing?</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Private Fraser</b><br />
			Very well, thank you, Captain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Excellent. Robinson, good to see ya.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He does a little mime of pointing a gun at him - all very jovial.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Private Robinson</b><br />
			Good to see you too, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And Corporal - how's the voice?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			Excellent, sir. Ready! Aim! ... Fire!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The squad snatch up their guns at his command.</i><br />
			<br />
			Wait for it! Wait for it!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The phone is on the hook, isn't it, Perkins?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			Oh, yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Splendid. So where do you want me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			Well, up against the wall is traditional.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Course it is. This side or the other side?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all laugh - what a jolly day.</i><br />
			<br />
			No messengers waiting, Perkins?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			Oh, I'm afraid not, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Fair enough, fair enough.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is starting to worry.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			All right, lads, line up.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The squad is ready.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now, look - I think there might have been a bit of a misunderstanding here. You see, I was
			expecting a telegram.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			Ten shun!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Quite an important one actually.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			Take aim!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They point their guns at him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			Stop!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think that's what they call the nick of time.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			It's a message for you, Captain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course it is. Read it please.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Perkins</b><br />
			'Here's looking at you - love from all the boys in the firing squad.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			You soft bastards, you!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Private Robinson</b><br />
			I saw the card - I couldn't resist it!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They are all giggling - very pleased with themselves.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			How thoughtful.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			Ten shun!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. Something's gone spectacularly badly wrong.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			Take aim.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick - you're mince-meat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sergeant Jones</b><br />
			F ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick and George are waking up where they passed out. They were clearly deeply, deeply
			drunk.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Groaning</i>) My head ... oh, my head ... feels like the time I was initiated into the
			Silly Buggers Society at Cambridge. I misheard the rules and tried to push a whole aubergine
			up my earhole.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Permission to die, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Now, what started us drinking ... ? Oh yes, we were celebrating getting Captain Blackadder
			off scot free ... Oh, my sainted trousers! We forgot!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He jumps up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, whoops.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I shall never forgive myself, he's dead dead dead because of us, because we're a pair of dirty
			rotten selfish so and sos. Oh, my God - I could just put a rope round my neck and bally well
			hang myself till it really hurt.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters, bright, breezy and casual, looking the room over.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Morning, George, Morning, Baldrick ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>They gape, open-mouthed in surprise, not quite believing that Blackadder is alive. Still
			the striking resemblance to guppy fish at feeding time.</i><br />
			<br />
			Yup. It arrived in the nick of time.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He waves the telegram.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Uncomprehending</i>) Oh, excellent.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah. See you've got the scotch out anyway.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, not at all. Of course, sir, we wanted to lay on a bit of a celebration for your safe return.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder helps himself to whisky, noting there's very little left.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			There was a second telegram which arrived, George, addressed to you personally from your uncle ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George reaches for it, but Blackadder casually opens it, and reads.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			'George, my boy ... Outraged to read in dispatches how that arse Melchett made a complete pig's
			ear of your chum Blackadder's court martial. Have reversed the decision forthwith. Surprised
			you didn't ask me to do it yourself, actually.'<br />
			<br />
			<i>He looks up at George and Baldrick. They know they 're in trouble.</i><br />
			<br />
			Now. This is interesting, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes ... well ... the thing is, sir ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You two got whammed last night, didn't you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, not whammed ... a little tiddly, perhaps ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And forgot the telegram to your uncle?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well ... no! No - not completely - I mean, partial ... ahm. Yes. Yes - entirely.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I think I can explain, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Can you, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			As I suspected. I'm not a religious man, as you know, but henceforth I shall pray nightly to
			the God who killed Cain and squashed Samson that he comes out of retirement and gets back into
			practice with the pair of you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The field phone rings. Blackadder snatches it up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, Captain Darling. Well, you know, some of us just have friends in high places, I suppose.
			No, I can hear you perfectly. You want what? You want two volunteers for a mission into No
