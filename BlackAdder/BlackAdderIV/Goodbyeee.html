			<b>SCENE ONE: THE TRENCH AND DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is night, it is pouring with rain and the shelling is constant. Blackadder and George have
			just inspected the troops in the trench. They are ankle-deep in mud.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Care for a smoke, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George offers Baldrick a cigarette.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Private?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Thank you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He eats it. Suddenly George gets emotional.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, dash and blast all this hanging about, sir. I'm as bored as a pacifist's pistol. When are we
			going to see some action?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, George, I strongly suspect your long wait for certain death is nearly at an end. Surely you
			must have noticed something in the air?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well yes, of course, but I thought that was Private Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Unless I'm much mistaken, soon we will at last be making the final big push, the one we've been
			so looking forward to all these years.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Hurrah with highly polished brass knobs on. About time!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The field phone rings: it is on Baldrick's back. Blackadder picks it up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hullo, Somme Public Baths. No running, shouting or piddling in the shallow end. Oh, it's you,
			Darling. Tomorrow at dawn. Oh, excellent. See yon later then. Bye!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hangs up.</i><br />
			<br />
			Gentlemen - our long wait is nearly at an end. Tomorrow morning, General 'Insanity' Melchett
			invites you to amass slaughter. We're going over the top.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Huzzah and hurrah! God Save the King, Rule Britannia and boo sucks to Harry Hun!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Or to put it more precisely, you're going over the top, I'm going to get out of it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and George move to the dug-out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, come on, Cap! May be a bit risky - but it's sure as bloomin' 'ell worth it, guv'nor.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder undresses while George resses for battle.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			How can it possibly be worth it? We've been sitting here since Christmas 1914, during which time
			millions of men have died, and we've moved no further than an asthmatic ant with heavy shopping.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			No, but this time I'm pos we'll break through - it's ice-cream in Berlin in fifteen days.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Or ice-cold in No Man's Land in fifteen seconds. No, the time has come to get out of this madness
			once and for all.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			What madness is that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, for God's sake, George, how long have yon been in the army?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			What, me? Oh, I joined up straight away - 10 August 1914. What a day that was. Myself and the
			fellows leap-frogging down to the Cambridge recruiting office, then playing tiddly-winks in the
			queue. We'd hammered the hell out of Oxford's tiddly-winkers only the week before and here we were
			off to hammer the Boche. A crashingly superb bunch of blokes, fine, clean-limbed - even our acne
			had a strange nobility about it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, and how are all the boys now?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, Jocko and the Badger bought it at the first Ypres, unfortunately - quite a shock that. I
			remember Bumfluff's house-master wrote and told me that Sticky had been out for a duck and the
			Gubber had snitched a parcel sausage-end and gone goose-over-stumps frog-side.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Meaning?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I don't know, sir, but I read in The Times that they'd both been killed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And Bumfluff himself?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Copped a packet at Gallipoli with the Ozzies. So did Drippy and Strangely
			Brown - I remember we heard on the first morning of the Somme when Titch and Mr Floppy got gassed
			back to Blighty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Which leaves?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Gosh, yes - I suppose I'm the only one of the Trinity's Tiddlers still alive. Cor blimey - there's
			a thought, and not a jolly one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My point exactly, George.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I might get a bit mis if it wasn't for the thought of going over the top tomorrow. Permission to
			get weaving, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Permission granted.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George exits to trench.</i><br />
			
			Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Captain B?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			This is a crisis, a large crisis. In fact, if you've got a moment, it is a twelve-storey crisis
			with a magnificent entrance hall, carpeted throughout; twenty-four-hour porterage and an enormous
			sign on the roof saying, 'This is a Large Crisis'. And a large crisis requires a large plan. Get
			me a ruler, two pencils and a pair of underpants.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Later, inside the dug-out. Blackadder has pants on his head, and a pencil up each nostril.
			Baldrick is in attendance.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now, Baldrick, this is an old trick I picked up in the Sudan. We tell HQ that I have gone insane
			and I will be invalided back to Blighty before you can say 'wibble', a poor gormless idiot.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But I'm a poor gormless idiot, sir, and I've never been invalided back to Blighty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Baldrick - but you never said 'wibble'. Go on - ask me some simple questions.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What is your name?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Wibble.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What is two plus two?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A wibble.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Where do you live?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			London.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Eh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A small village on Mars, just outside the capital city, Wibble.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter George.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			All present and correct, sir. Ready for the off, eh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm afraid not, Lieutenant. I'm just off to Hartlepool to buy some exploding trousers.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Come again, sir! Have you gone barking mad?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, George, I have - cluck cluck gibber gibber - my old man's a mushroom, etc. Go and send a runner
			to tell General Melchett your Captain has gone insane and must return to England at once.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			But, sir - how utterly ghastly for you. I mean, you'll miss the whole of the war!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes - very bad luck. Beep.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Right ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Beep.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I'll be back as soon as I can.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Pap paa.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Whatever you do, don't excite him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Fat chance.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George exits. Blackadder takes off some of his mad garb.</i><br />
			<br />
			Now, all we have to do is wait.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He makes himself comfortable for a long night ahead.</i><br />
			<br />
			Baldrick, fix us some coffee, will you ... and try and make it taste slightly less like mud this time.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Not easy, I'm afraid, Captain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And why is that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Because it is mud. We ran out of coffee thirteen months ago.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So every time I've drunk your coffee since, I have in fact been drinking hot mud.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			With sugar.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Which of course makes all the difference.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, it would do if we had any sugar. But we ran out New Year's Eve 1915, since when I've been
			using sugar substitute.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Which is?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Dandruff.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Brilliant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Still, I could add some milk this time - well, saliva.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, thanks, Baldrick. Call me Mr Picky, but I've decided to cancel the coffee.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That's probably because you're mad, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, quite.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George rejoins them.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Didn't go down at all well, sir. Captain Darling said they'd be here directly - but you better be
			pretty damn doolally.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't worry, George, I am.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He does some mad actions.</i><br />
			<br />
			When they get here, I'll show them what totally and utterly bonkerooni means. Fwaaaff. Till then,
			there's bugger-all to do except sit and wait.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Or we could have a jolly game of charades.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			And a good sing-a-long of music hall hits like 'Birmingham Bertie' and 'Whoops, Mrs Miggins,
			You're Sitting on My Artichokes!'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. I think bugger-all might be rather more fun.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A sense of genuine time totally on their hands.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Permission to ask a question, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Permission granted Baldrick, as long as it isn't the one about where babies come from.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No. The thing is - the way I see it, these days there's a war on, right? And ages ago, there wasn't
			a war on, right? So there must have been a moment when there not being a war went away, right, and
			there being a war came along, right? So what I want to know is, how did we get from the one case of
			affairs to the other case of affairs, right?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You mean, how did the war start?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Authoritatively</i>) The war started because of the vile Hun and his villainous empire-building.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			George, the British empire at present covers a quarter of the globe while the German empire
			consists of a small sausage factory in Tanganyika. I hardly think we can be entirely absolved from
			blame on the imperialistic front.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, no sir, absolutely not, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He looks at Blackadder pityingly and taps the side of his head.</i><br />
			<br />
			(<i>To Baldrick</i>) Mad as a bicycle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I heard it started when some chap called Archie Duke shot an ostrich because he was hungry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think you mean it started when the Arch-Duke of Austro-Hungary got shot.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No - there was definitely an ostrich involved.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well possibly. But the real reason for the whole thing was that it was just too much effort not
			to have a war.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			By gum this is interesting. I always loved history - The Battle of Hastings, Henry VIII and his
			Six Knives.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, you see, Baldrick, in order to prevent a war in Europe, two super blocs developed: us, the
			French and the Russians on one side, and the Germans and Austro-Hungary on the other. The idea
			was to have two vast opposing
			armies, each acting as the other's deterrent. That way there could never be a war.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Except, well, this is a sort of war, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's right, there was one tiny flaw in the plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, what was that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It was bollocks.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			So the poor old ostrich died for nothing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			(<i>From outside</i>) Ten shun!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			They're here, Baldrick. Keep him warm while I go and prepare the ground.
			George goes out to meet Melchett and Darling in the trench.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			George, how's the patient?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Very much touch and go, sir - can't vouch for his behaviour at all. He's gone mad, you see,
			stir-fry crazy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I see. Is that genuinely mad? ... Or has he just put his underpants on his head and stuffed
			two pencils up his nose?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ah, well ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			That 's what they all used to do in the Sudan. I remember I once had to shoot a whole platoon
			for trying that.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Errr ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, let's have a look at him.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder suddenly stands in front of Baldrick. He is still in his mad gear.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And the other thing they used to do in the Sudan was to get dressed up like this and pretend to
			be mad, but don't let me catch you trying that one, Baldrick, or I'll have yon shot - dismissed.
			Oh, hello, General (<i>very smoothly</i>), didn't see you come in.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Now then, Blackadder. They told me you've gone mad.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, sir, must be a communication break-down. Someone clearly heard I was 'mad' with excitement,
			waiting for the off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You see, Darling, I told you there'd be a Perfectly good explanation. Come on then, George,
			have your chaps fall in.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Well, that's very odd, sir. The message was very clear: 'Captain Blackadder
			gone totally tonto - bring strait-jacket for immediate return to Blighty.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Don't be ridiculous, Darling. The hero of Mboto Gorge - mad? Look at him, he's as
			sane as I am. Baah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Was that the Mboto Gorge when we massacred the peace-loving pigmies of the Upper Volta and
			stole all their fruit?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No - totally different Mboto Gorge.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He pauses.</i><br />
			<br />
			Cup of coffee, Darling?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Oh, thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, do the honours.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir. (<i>To Darling</i>) Sugar, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Three lumps.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Can you manage three lumps, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'll rummage around and see what I can find.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Make it a milky one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Coming up.<br />
			<br />
			<i>In the trench.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			So, George - looking forward to the big push?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Absolutely, sir - at last, our chance to show the Hun that it takes more than a pointy hat and
			bad breath to defeat the armies of King George.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			That's the spirit!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The sound of Baldrick spitting is heard.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Back in the dug-out. Baldrick hands Darling the coffee. He splutters in horror at its taste.
			Big smile from Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Oh, cappuccino. Got any of that brown stuff you sprinkle on the top?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm sure I ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No. No.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder pushes Baldrick out of the way.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Ten shun!<br />
			<br />
			<i>All stand to attention.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			At ease. Fine body of men out there.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir - shortly to become fine bodies of men.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Oh, nonsense. You'll pull through. I remember when we thrashed the old Harrovians back in 1895,
			they all said we'd never get through their back line - but we ducked and we bobbed and we wove
			and we damn well won the game, 15-4.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir - but the Harrow full back wasn't armed with a heavy machine-gun.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			No, that's a good point. Make a note, Darling: recommendation for the Harrow governors, heavy
			machine-guns for full backs. Excellent idea, Blackadder. Now then, Private - looking forward
			to giving those Frenchies a good licking?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No, sir, it's the Germans we'll be licking.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Don't be revolting, Darling! I wouldn't lick a German if he was glazed in honey.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Sorry, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Now you, soldier, do you love your country, soldier?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Certainly do, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			And do you love your king?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Certainly don't, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Why not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My mum told me never to trust men with beards.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Excellent native Cockney wit. (<i>He hits Baldrick</i>) Well, good luck to all of you.
			Sorry I can't be with you, but ... obviously there's no place in the front line for an old
			general with a dicky heart and a wooden bladder.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns to go.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, George, by the way, if you feel like coming back to HQ - hear the results as they come in
			tomorrow - there's a spare place in the car.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder looks at George.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, no, thank you, sir. Wouldn't miss this for the world. I'm as excited as an excited person
			who's got a special reason to be excited.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			That's my boy! Must be going - tally-ho and pip pip all. I'll see you all in Berlin for coffee
			and cake ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling spits out coffee.</i><br />
			<br />
			What is the matter with you today, Darling? I'm terribly sorry, Blackadder. Come on, Darling -
			we're going.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They exit. Blackadder sinks in despair.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			By Jove, sir - I'm glad you're not barking any more.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you, George - although it looks like you are. You were offered a way out and you didn't
			take it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Absolutely not, sir, can't wait to get stuck into the Boche.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Exasperated</i>) You won't get time to get stuck into the Boche. We'll all be cut to pieces
			by machine-gun fire before we have time to yell 'Charge'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			So what shall we do now?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Shall I do my war poem, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			How hurt will you be if I give the honest answer, which is, 'No - I'd rather French-kiss a skunk'?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			So would I, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good, fire away, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Hear the words I sing,<br />
			Wars a horrid thing.<br />
			But still I sing, sing, sing<br />
			Ding a ling a ling.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Clapping</i>) Bravo!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It started badly, it tailed off a little in the middle and the less said about the end the
			better - but apart from that it was excellent.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Shall I do another one then, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We wouldn't want to exhaust you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, don't worry, I could go on all night.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not with a bayonet through the neck you couldn't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			This one's called 'The German Guns'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, spiffing! Let's hear that!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder puts his head in his hands.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Boom, boom, boom, boom,<br />
			Boom, boom, boom,<br />
			Boom boom boom boom.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Boom boom boom?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			How did you guess?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Gosh! Spooky, eh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Wildly</i>) I'm sorry, but I've just got to get out of here.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I have a cunning plan, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right, Baldrick, for old time's sake.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You phone Field Marshal Haig and ask him to get you out of here.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, even by your standards, it's pathetic. I've only ever met Field Marshal Haig once and
			it was over twenty years ago - and my God, you've got it, you've got it!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He kisses Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, if I've got it, you've got it too, now, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I can't believe I've been so stupid! One phone call will do it - one phone call and I'll be free.
			Let's see - it's 3.30 - I'll call about quarter to six. Excellent, excellent! Ah! (<i>Huge satisfied
			sigh</i>) Now where were we? I must get packing.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Totally accessible and bonhomous, he starts to pack his case merrily.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			You know, I won't half miss you chaps after the war.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Don't worry, Lieutenant, I'll come visit you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, will you really? Bravo, yes! Jump in the jalopy and come down to stay in the country. We can
			relive the old times.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What - dig a hole in the middle of the garden, fill it with water and get the game-keeper to
			shoot at us all day?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			That's the one thing I don't understand, you know, Captain. You're a professional soldier, and
			yet sometimes you sound as if you bally well haven't enjoyed soldiering at all.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, you see, I did like it, George, back in the old days when the prerequisite of a British
			battle was that the enemy should, under no circumstances, carry guns ... Even spears made us think
			twice. The kind of people we liked to fight most were two feet tall and armed with dry grass.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, but come off it, sir. What about Mboto Gorge, for heaven's sake?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, that was a nasty one. Ten thousand Watutsi warriors armed to the teeth with kiwi fruit and
			guava halves. After the battle, instead of taking prisoners, we
			simply made a huge fruit salad. When I joined up, I never imagined anything as awful as this
			war. Fifteen years of military experience perfecting the art of
			ordering a pink gin and saying, 'do you do it doggy doggy?' in Swahili, then suddenly four and
			a half million heavily armed Germans hove into view. It. was a shock, I can tell you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I thought it was going to be such fun too. We all did. Joining a local regiment and everything.
			The Turnip Street Workhouse Pals: I'll never forget. It was great - the first time I've ever really
			felt popular, everyone was cheering and throwing flowers, a girl actually came up and kissed me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>To George</i>) Poor woman - first casualty of the war.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I loved the training, all we had to do was bayonet sacks full of straw - even I could do it. I
			remember telling my mum, 'these sacks will be easy to outwit in a battle situation.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder throws Baldrick a look and bangs his pipe on the post.</i><br />
			<br />
			And then we all met up just before Christmas 1914 ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes, that's right. I'd just arrived and we had that wonderful Christmas truce ... do you remember,
			sir? We could hear 'Silent Night' drifting across the still clear air of No Man's Land ... And
			then they came, the Germans ... emerging out of the freezing night mist, calling to us, and we
			clambered up over the top and went to meet them ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Both sides advanced further during one Christmas piss-up than we've managed in the next two and a
			half years.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Sir, sir, do you remember the football match, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Remember it? How could I forget it. I was never off side, I could not believe that decision!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Since then we've been stuck here for three flipping years, we haven't moved! All my friends are
			dead: my pet spider, Sammy, Katie the worm, Bertie the bird -everyone except Neville the fat hamster.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Solemn</i>) I'm afraid Neville bought it too, Baldrick ... I'm sorry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Neville - gone, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Actually, not quite gone, he's in the corner bunging up the sink.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick gets up and wanders across the room.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			(<i>Upset</i>) But it didn't have to happen. If it wasn't for this terrible war
			Neville might still be alive today, sniffling his little nose and going 'eek'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			On the other hand, if he hadn't died I wouldn't have been able to insert a curtain rod in his
			bottom and use him as a dish mop.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Why can't we stop, sir? Why can't we just say, 'no more killing, let's all go home'? Why can't
			we pack it in? Why?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Leaping up</i>) Now, look here, you just stop that conchie talk right now, Private. It's
			absurd, it's bolshevism and wouldn't work anyway.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			(<i>Innocently</i>) But why not, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Why not? Erm, you mean, why, why wouldn't it work? Well, it wouldn't work, because ... it wouldn't
			work because ... get on with polishing your boots, Private - and less of that lip.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns to Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			It's all right, sir - I think I've crushed the mutiny. To think, in a few hours, at last we're
			going to be off! Not that I won't miss all this though - ha - we've had some times, haven't we?
			We've had some damnably good laughs, eh?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Pause.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. Can't think of any specific ones myself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: MELCHETT'S HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The lights are on very low. Melchett comes in wearing a dressing gown and a beautiful hair-net
			over his moustache.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling has dozed off at the desk.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Darling!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling jumps up at the sound of his voice.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Can't sleep either, eh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No, sir. Thinking about the push, sir. Hoping the Boche'll forget to set their alarm clocks,
			oversleep and still be in their pyjamas when our boys turn up, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, yes. I've been thinking, too. Darling ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You know - over these last years, I've come to think of you as a sort of son. Not a favourite son,
			of course - Lord no! - more a sort of illegitimate, backstairs sort of sprog. You know, the sort
			of spotty squit you never really like - but still fruit of my overactive loins.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Thank you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			And I want to do what's best for you, Darling. So I've thought about it a great deal and I want
			you to have this ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hands him a piece of paper.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			(<i>Trying to look pleased</i>) A postal order for ten shillings.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Ah - no - sorry. My godson's wedding present.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hands over another piece of paper.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Ah, no, sir - this is a commission for the front line, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He tries to hand it back.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes. I've been awfully selfish keeping you back here instead of letting you join in all the fun and
			games. This will let you get to the front line immediately.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			But, sir - I don't want to ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			To leave me? I appreciate that, Darling. But dammit - I'll just have to enter Berlin without someone
			to carry my special feathery hat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No, sir - I mean, I don't want to go into battle ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett won't let Darling finish his sentences.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			... without me? I know. But I'm too old. I'll just have to sit this one out on the touchline with
			the half-time oranges and the fat wheezy boys with a note from matron, while you young bloods link
			arms for the glorious final scrum down.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling stands up, and comes round next to General Melchett.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			You're not listening, sir. I'm begging - please, for the sake of all the times I've helped you with
			your dickie bows and your dicky bladder, please ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He falls on his knees in front of the General.</i><br />
			<br />
			... don't make me ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			(<i>Patting him reassuringly on the head</i>) ... go through the farewell debagging ceremony in
			the mess? No, I've spared you that, you touchingly sentimental young booby. Look - no fuss, no
			bother - the driver is already here.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The door opens. Light floods in, shining on Darling's face. A big shadow appears at the door,
			and he turns round, still on his knees, to face it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			But ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			No, not a word. Believe me, Kevin. I know what you want to say. I know.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett stands.</i><br />
			<br />
			Goodbye, Kevin Darling. He salutes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Goodbye, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He salutes and walks sadly to the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: THE DUG-OUT / THE TRENCH AND FIELD MARSHAL HAIG'S STAFF HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It's dawn and becoming a little lighter. Blackadder has his coat and hat on, and is ready to
			go. Baldrick is looking out of the dug-out flap.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It's stopped raining at last, begging your pardon, sir. Looks like we might have a nice day for it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George goes to the dug-out entrance.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes, it's nearly morning ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good Lord, so it is - time to make my call. (<i>He dials breezily. It answers</i>) Hello, Field
			Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, please. Yes, it's urgent.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Haig is standing in his very opulent office, in front of a battle reconstruction, with lots of
			tiny model soldiers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Haig</b><br />
			Haig.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hello, Sir Douglas.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Haig</b><br />
			Who is this?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			This is Captain Blackadder, sir. Erstwhile of the 19/45th East African Rifles.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Haig</b><br />
			Good Lord! Blackie!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He knocks over one set of soldiers with a deft sweep of the hand.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Haig</b><br />
			(<i>Knocking over another set</i>) By heaven, Blackie - I haven't seen you since ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			'92, sir. Mboto Gorge.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Haig</b><br />
			By jingo, yes. We sure gave those pigmies a good squashing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Certainly did, sir. And do you remember ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Haig</b><br />
			My God, yes - you saved my damn life that day, Blackie. If it weren't for you, that pigmy woman
			with the sharpened mango could have seriously ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, yes, sir. And do you remember you said then that if I was ever in real trouble, if I ever
			really needed a favour, I was to call you and you'd do anything you could to help me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Haig</b><br />
			Yes, yes I do. And I stick by it. You know me, not a man to change my mind.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He starts sweeping up the toy soldiers with a dustpan and brush.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, we've noticed that.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Haig</b><br />
			So, what do you want? Spit it out, man.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He chucks the dustpan 's contents over his shoulder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, sir, it's like this. I'll be blunt. It's the big push today and I'm not all that keen to go
			over the top.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Haig</b><br />
			(<i>Not happy</i>) Ah. Oh, I see. Well ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He sits down.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Casually</i>) It was a viciously sharp mango slice, wasn't it, sir ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Haig</b><br />
			Well, this is most irregular, but, all right. But if I fix it for you I never want to hear from
			you again, is that clear?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He picks up one of the toy soldiers he's knocked over and sets it upright.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Suits me, Duggie.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Haig</b><br />
			Very well, listen carefully, Blackadder, I won't repeat this. Right - first put your underpants
			on your head, and two pencils up your nose. They'll think you're
			crazy and send you home. Right, favour returned.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hangs up. Blackadder is not amused.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think the phrase rhymes with 'clucking bell'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Does that mean that you're going to have to go over the top now?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder nods. Phone rings. Blackadder leaps on it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Field Marshal!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			(<i>At his HQ</i>) Ha! Ha! No - not quite. Or not yet. Blackadder, wanted to let you know I've
			sent a little surprise over for you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling appears framed in the door of the trench in fighting gear.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Captain Darling.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He puts down the phone. They stare at each other knowing what it means for both of them.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Captain Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Here to join us for the last waltz?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Ahm - yes, that's right - tired of folding the general's pyjamas.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, this is splendid comradely news! Together we'll fight for king and country and be sucking
			sausages in Berlin by tea-time ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. I hope the cafes are well stocked. Everyone seems determined to eat out the moment they arrive.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			But really this is brave, splendid, and noble ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder doesn't react. Long pause as all four stand together.</i><br />
			<br />
			Sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Lieutenant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I'm scared, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm scared too, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I'm the last of the tiddly-winking leap froggers from the golden summer of 1914. I don't want
			to die ... I'm really not over keen on dying at all, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			How are you feeling, Darling?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Ahm - not all that good, Blackadder. Rather hoped I'd get through the whole show, go back to
			work at Pratt and Sons, keep wicket for the Croydon Gentlemen, marry Doris. Made a note in my
			diary on the way here. Simply says: 'Bugger'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, quite.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Outside is heard the muffled faraway cry: 'Stand to, stand to, fix bayonets!'</i><br />
			<br />
			Come on, come on, let's move.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all move out. At the door, Blackadder turns to George.</i><br />
			<br />
			Don't forget your stick, Lieutenant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Picking up his stick</i>) Rather, sir. Wouldn't want to face a machine-gun without this.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They emerge in the misty trenches and all stand in a line, ready for the off. Then suddenly
			there is a silence. The machine-guns stop.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I say, listen - our guns have stopped.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			You don't think ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Perhaps the war's over. Perhaps it's peace.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Hurrah! The big nobs have got round a table and yanked the iron out of the fire.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Thank God - we lived through it - The Great War, 1914 to 1917.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All Three</b><br />
			Hip hip hurray!!!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm afraid not. The guns have stopped because we are about to attack. Not even our generals
			are mad enough to shell their own men. They feel it's more sporting to let the Germans do it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			So, we are, in fact, going over. This is, as they say, it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, unless I can think of something very quickly.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A command is heard: 'Company, one pace forward. ' They all take one step forward.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			There's a nasty splinter on that ladder, sir. A bloke could hurt himself on that.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A call: 'Stand ready. ' They put their hands on the ladders, ready to climb over.</i><br />
			<br />
			I have a plan, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Really, Baldrick, a cunning and subtle one?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			As cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Another call is heard: 'On the signal, Company will advance.'</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I'm afraid it's too late. Whatever it was, I'm sure it was better than my plan to get
			out of this by pretending to be mad. I mean, who would have noticed another madman round here?<br />
			<br />
			<i>A whistle goes. He looks at Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			Good luck, everyone.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder blows his whistle. There is a roar of voices - everyone leaps up the ladders.
			As they rise above the sandbags they are met by thunderous machine-gun fire.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder, Baldrick, George and Darling run on, brandishing their hand-guns. They will
			not get far.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Silence falls. Our soldiers fade away. No Man's Land turns slowly into a peaceful field
			of poppies. The only sound is that of a bird, singing sweetly.</i>
