			<b>SCENE ONE: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A dug-out in a trench in the middle of the Great War. There is a general atmosphere of mud.
			It contains table, chair, bed, Captain Blackadder and Private Baldrick. 'Pomp and Circumstance'
			plays on the gramophone.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is reading, but there is a tiny annoying scratching sound. He shifts slightly,
			trying to ignore it but finally, can't ... He lifts the needle on the gramophone, but the scratch
			continues ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, what are you doing out there?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm carving something on this bullet, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>That's the scratching noise.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What are you carving?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm carving 'Baldrick', sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Why?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It's a cunning plan, actually.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course it is.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You know they say that somewhere there's a bullet with your name on it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, I thought if I owned the bullet with my name on it, then I'll never get hit by it. Because
			I won't ever shoot myself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Shame.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			And the chances of there being two bullets with my name on them are very small indeed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, it's not the only thing round here that's very small indeed. Your brain's so minute, Baldrick,
			that if a hungry cannibal cracked your head open, there wouldn't be enough to cover a small water
			biscuit ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>George enters, with a nice new revolver and a magazine. He is a very enthusiastic, bright-eyed
			and bubble-headed young officer.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Tally-ho, pip pip and Bernard's Your Uncle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			In English we say 'Good morning'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Excited</i>) Look what I've got for you, sir!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick goes outside into the trench.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			The latest issue of King and Country. Damn inspiring stuff. 'The magazine that tells the Tommies
			the truth about the war.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Or, alternatively, the greatest work of fiction since vows of fidelity were included in the French
			marriage service.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Come, come, sir, you can't deny that this fine newspaper is good for the morale of the men.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Certainly not. I just feel that more could be achieved by giving them some real toilet paper.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Not with you at all, sir. What could any patriotic chap have against this magnificent mag?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Apart from his bottom?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well look at it. This stuff is about as convincing as Dr Crippen's defence lawyer! The British
			Tommies are all portrayed as six foot six with biceps the size of Bournemouth.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Exactly - thoroughly inspiring stuff. Oh, and look, sir, this also arrived for you this morning.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George holds out a gun wrapped in a brown paper bag. Blackadder unwraps it and handles it
			thoughtfully.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Do you know what this is, Lieutenant?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			It's a good old service revolver.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Wrong - it's a brand new service revolver, which I've suspiciously been sent without asking for it.
			I smell something fishy and I'm not talking about the contents of Baldrick's apple crumble.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			It's funny, we didn't ask for those new trench-climbing ladders either ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			New ladders?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes, sir. Came yesterday. I issued them to the men and they were absolutely thrilled.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shouts out to the trench.</i><br />
			<br />
			Isn't that right, men?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick appears at the door to the dugout.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir. First solid fuel we've had since we burnt the cat.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder goes out to the trench, followed by George.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mmm - something's going on, and I think I can make an educated guess what it is - something which
			you, George, would find hard to do.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			True. When I was at school, education could go hang. As long as a boy could hit a six, sing the
			school song very loud and take a hot crumpet from behind without blubbing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, I, on the other hand, am a fully - rounded human being - a degree from the University of Life,
			a diploma from the school of hard knocks and three gold stars from the kindergarten of getting the
			shit kicked out of me. And my instincts lead me to deduce that we are at last about to go ... over
			the top.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Great Scott, sir, you don't think the moment's finally arrived to give Harry Hun a darn good
			British-style thrashing, six 0' the best, trousers down?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			If you mean are we all going to get killed, the answer is 'yes'. Clearly Field Marshal Haig is about
			to make yet another gargantuan effort to move his drinks cabinet six inches closer to Berlin.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Bravo-issimo! Let's make a start, eh - up and over to glory! Last one in Berlin 's a rotten egg!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He makes a move to charge up and over the trench walls.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Give me your helmet, Lieutenant.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George gives Blackadder his hat. He throws it up in the air. Massive machine-gunfire is heard.
			The hat descends totally perforated with bullet holes.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes, some clever hat camouflage might be in order.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He heads off sparkily.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Permission to speak, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Granted - with a due sense of exhaustion and dread.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I have a cunning plan to get us out of getting killed, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, yes. What is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Cooking.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I see.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You see, sir, Staff HQ are always on the look-out for good cooks. Well, we go over, and we cook
			something and get out of the trenches that way.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, it's a brilliant plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It is?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, it's superb.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Permission to write home immediately, sir - this is the first brilliant plan a Baldrick has ever
			had. For centuries we've tried, and they've always turned out to be total pig swill. My mother will
			be as pleased as Punch.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			If she were as good-looking as Punch, we'd all be a lot happier. There is, however, one slight flaw
			in the plan, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You're the worst cook in the entire world.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, yes, that's right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			There are amoeba on Saturn who can boil a better egg than you. Your filets mignons in sauce béarnaise
			look like dog turds in glue ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That's because they are ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Your plum duff tastes like a molehill decorated with rabbit droppings ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I thought you wouldn't notice ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And your cream custard has the texture of cat's vomit ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Again, it ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			If you were to serve up one of your meals in Staff HQ, you would be arrested for the greatest mass
			poisoning since Lucretia Borgia invited 500 of her close friends round for a wine and anthrax party.
			No, we'll have to think up a slightly better plan than that.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Right, how about a nice meal while you chew it over?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What's on the menu?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick produces a rat as if a bottle of wine.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Rat - sautéed or fricassee.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder puts on glasses.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh - the agony of choice. And sautéed involves?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well you take the freshly shaved rat, and you marinate it in a puddle for a while.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mhm, for how long?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Until it's drowned. After that you stretch it out under a hot light bulb, then you get within
			dashing distance of a latrine and you scoff it right down.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I see. so that's sautéing, and fricasseeing?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Exactly the same. Just a slightly bigger rat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, call me Old Mr Unadventurous, but I think I'll give it a miss this once ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Fair enough - more for the rest of us, eh, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Absolutely, Private, tally ho, barf, barf!<br />
			<br />
			<i>George has just popped back in. The hat on his head is camouflaged by a coil of barbed wire
			wrapped round it. The field telephone rings. Blackadder answers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hello, the Savoy Grill. Oh, it's you - yes, I'll be over there in forty minutes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He puts the phone down.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Who was that, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Strangely enough, Baldrick, that was his Holiness Pope Gregory IX inviting me to join him for
			drinks aboard his steam yacht Saucy Sue currently wintering in Montego Bay with the England cricket
			team and the Balinese Goddess of Plenty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, not really. I've been ordered to HQ - no doubt means that idiot General Melchett is about to
			offer me an attractive new opportunity to have my brains blown out for Britain.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He puts on his greatcoat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: STAFF HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is a grand room, clearly purloined from a French mayor. There is a grand marble fireplace and
			a grand desk, at which Darling is sitting and writing. Maps cover the wall, filing cabinets and
			charts are off to one side. Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What do you want, Darling?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			It's Captain Darling to you. General Melchett wants to see you about a highly important secret mission.<br />
			<br />
			<i>General Melchett enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			What's going on, Darling?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling jumps up immediately from behind Melchett's desk.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Captain Blackadder to see you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Ah, excellent - short back and sides today, I think, please.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No, sir - that's Corporal Black. Sir - Captain Blackadder is here about the other matter, sir.
			The 'secret' matter.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Oh, yes, of course. The special mission. At ease, Blackadder. Now what I am about to tell you is
			absolutely tip-top secret, is that clear?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It is, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I've compiled a list of those with security clearance. Have you got it, Darling?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Read it, please.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			It's top security - I think that's all the captain needs to know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Nonsense - let's hear the list in full!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Very well, sir. (<i>Reading</i>) List of personnel cleared for Mission Gainsborough, as dictated
			by General C. H. Melchett: you and me, Darling, obviously, Field Marshal Haig, Field Marshal
			Haig's wife, all Field Marshal Haig's wife's friends, their families, their families' servants,
			their families' servants' tennis partners and some chap I bumped into in the mess the other day
			called Bernard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			So it's maximum security. Is that clear?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Quite clear, sir. Only myself and the rest of the English - speaking world is to know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Good man!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett now leads Blackadder across to the map table.</i><br />
			<br />
			Now Field Marshal Haig has formulated a brilliant tactical plan to ensure final victory in the
			field.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Would this brilliant plan involve us climbing over the top of our trenches and walking slowly
			towards the enemy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			How did you know that, Blackadder? It's classified information.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's the same plan that we used last time, sir. And the seventeen times before that.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all move over to the desk.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			E-e-exactly! And that's what's so brilliant about it. It will catch the watchful Hun totally off
			guard. Doing exactly what we've done eighteen times before will be the last thing they'll expect
			us to do this time. There is, however, one problem.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That everyone always gets slaughtered in the first ten seconds?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Exactly. Field Marshal Haig is concerned that this may be depressing the men a tadge, so he's
			looking for a way to cheer the men up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			His resignation and suicide seem the obvious answer.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Interesting thought. Note it, Darling.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			(<i>Uneasy</i>) Sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>But Melchett has another thought. He reaches into a drawer.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Take a look at this - I'm sure you know it. King and Country.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sir - without question my favourite magazine. It's soft, it's strong and thoroughly absorbent.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Top hole, Blackadder. I thought it would be right up your alley. And Field Marshal Haig's plan is
			this: to commission a man to do an especially stirring painting for the cover of the next issue to
			inspire the men for the secret push. So what I want you to do, Blackadder, is labour night and day
			to find us a first-rate artist amongst your men.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Impossible. I know from long experience all my men have the artistic talent of a cluster of
			colour-blind hedgehogs in a bag.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			That's a bit of a blow. We needed a man to leave the trenches immediately.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Leave the trenches? I wonder if you have enjoyed, as I have, sir, the marvellous painting in the
			National Portrait Gallery - Bag Interior by the Colour - Blind Hedgehog Workshop of Siena.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I'm sorry, are you saying you can find this man?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder moves over to the map on the wall.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think I can, and might I suggest, sir, that having left the trenches it might be a good idea to
			have our man posted to Paris (<i>he points nonchalantly at Paris on the map</i>) to soak up a
			little artistic atmosphere there - perhaps even Tahiti (<i>gesticulating airily at another map</i>)
			so as to produce a real masterpiece.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling is alarmed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, yes! But can you find the man?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now I know I can, sir. Before you can say 'Sunflowers', I'll have Vincent van Gogh standing before
			you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: THE TRENCH</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The trench has been turned into an informal artists' commune. Blackadder has an easel and
			Baldrick a drawing board. George is looking over Blackadder:' shoulder, uming and ahing over
			the painting. Finally Blackadder stops, turns round and looks at him in annoyance.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			No no, don't stop, it's coming, sir, it's definitely coming. I - hmm. I, I just wonder whether
			two socks and a hand-grenade are really the sort of inspiring stuff that covers of King and
			Country are made of.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			They will be when I've painted them shoved up the Kaiser's backside.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ah, now this is interesting.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What is?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Private Baldrick is obviously a bit of an impressionist.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The only decent impression he can do is of a man with no talent. What's it actually called,
			Baldrick? The Vomiting Cavalier?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			No, sir, that's not supposed to be vomit. It's dabs of light.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, it's vomit.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ah, now why did you choose that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You told me to, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Did I?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir. You told me to paint whatever comes from within ... so I did my breakfast. Look there's
			a little tomato.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Really, this is hopeless - if only I'd paid attention in nursery art classes instead of spending
			my entire time manufacturing huge papier mâché willies to frighten Sarah Wallis.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Funny - painting was the only thing I was ever any good at.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, it's a pity you didn't keep it up.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George goes into the dug-out, waffling apologetically.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			<i>Well, as a matter of fact I did actually. I mean normally of course I wouldn't show them to
			anyone, because they're just embarrassing daubs really - but they give me pleasure - embarrassed
			to show them to you now, really - well, for what they're worth, should have my hands cut off ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes out a stack of drawings from under his bed. They're very good.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			These are brilliant, George. Why didn't you mention these before?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, you know, one doesn't like to blow one's own trumpet.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, but you might at least have told us you had a trumpet. These paintings could spell my way
			out of the trenches.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yours?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's right, ours. All you have to do is paint something heroic to appeal to the simple-minded
			Tommy. Over to you, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What about a Noble Tommy standing with a look of horror and disgust over the murdered body of a
			nun, brutally done over by a nasty German?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Excellent - I can see it now - the Nun and the Hun!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Splendid - no time to lose. George - set up your easel, Baldrick and I will pose. This is art's
			greatest moment since Mona Lisa sat down and told Leonardo da Vinci she was in a slightly odd
			mood. Baldrick, you lie down and be the nun.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm not lying down there - it's all wet!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Let me put it this way - you can either lie down and get all wet or you can be knocked down and
			get a broken nose.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Actually, it's not that wet is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He flicks Baldrick to the ground. There is a squelch of huge wetness. Baldrick looks up, his
			face covered in mud.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			And who are you going to be then, sir ... the noble Tommy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Precisely, standing over the body of the ravaged nun.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I want a wimple.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, you should have gone before we started the picture.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You know, the funny thing is - my father was a nun.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, he wasn't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			He was so, I know because whenever he was in court and the judge used to say 'Occupation', he'd
			say 'Nun'.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George has been in the dug-out, changing. He returns in a big shirt and a beret, transformed
			as best he can into an artist.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, you ready?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes, if you'd just like to pop your clothes on a stool.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm sorry?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Just pop your clothes on the stool over there.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You mean ... you want me ... tackle out?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, I would have thought so, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			If I can remind you of the realities of battle, George, one of the first things everyone
			notices is that all the protagonists keep their clothes on. Neither we nor the Hun favour fighting
			our battles <i>au naturel</i> ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			It's artistic licence, sir ... it's the willing suspension of disbelief.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, well, I'm not having anyone staring in disbelief at my willy suspension. Just get on and
			paint the bloody thing, sharpish.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder poses for picture.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>An hour later. Blackadder, George and Baldrick are inspecting the painting.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Brilliant, George - it's a masterpiece. The wimple suits you, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But it completely covers my face!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Exactly. Now men, General Melchett will be here any moment. When he arrives, leave the talking
			to me, all right. I like to keep an informal trench, but today, you may only speak with my
			express permission. Is that clear?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They don't reply.</i><br />
			<br />
			Is that clear?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Still no reply. Their eyes are bulging. Then at last Blackadder twigs.</i><br />
			<br />
			Permission to speak.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George and Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir. All clear, Sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>From the trench a loud cry is heard: 'Ten Shun!' Melchett and Darling enter.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Dug-out - ten - shun!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Excellent. At ease. Afternoon, Blackadder Where would you like me to sit? I thought just a
			little trim of the moustache, nothing drastic.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No, sir - we're here about the paintings.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Oh, yes! Good Lord! George, how are you, my boy?<br />
			<br />
			<i>George remains silent</i><br />
			<br />
			I said, how are you?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder, not having been concentrating, suddenly realizes that George isn't speaking.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh yes - permission to speak.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Thank you. I'm absolutely top-hole, sir, with a ying and a yang and yippideedoo.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Splendid - your Uncle Bertie sends his regards: I told him you could have a week off in April -
			don't want you to miss the Boat Race, do we?<br />
			<br />
			<i>George looks questioningly at Blackadder - Blackadder suddenly clicks, and nods.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Permission to speak.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Certainly not, sir. Permission to sing boisterously, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			If you must.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Sings</i>) Row, row, row your punt!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett and George</b><br />
			Gently down the stream,<br />
			Belts off, trousers down!<br />
			Isn't life a scream!<br />
			Oi!<br />
			<br />
			<i>All this is done with a little accompanying dance ending on a pelvic thrusting movement.
			Darling applauds enthusiastically and Blackadder claps drily.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Fabulous. University education - you can't beat it, can you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Bravo ... What have we here? Name?!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick looks at Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Permission to speak.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Baldrick, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Ha ha! Tally ho! Yippidee dap and zing zang spillett. Looking forward to the final chukker?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick says nothing. Blackadder wishes he'd never started this.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Permission to speak.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick still says nothing.</i><br />
			<br />
			Answer the general, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I can't answer him, sir, I don't know what he's talking about, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett decides to speak to him like an intelligent foreigner.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Are - you - looking - forward - to - the - big - push ?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He pinches his cheek indulgently.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			(<i>Answers the same way, and pinches the general's cheek back</i>) No - sir - I'm - absolutely
			- terrified.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Mnmm! The healthy humour of the honest Tommy! And if you should falter my boy, always remember
			that Captain Darling and I are behind you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			About thirty - five miles behind you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling, rather annoyed by this, twitches a little.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Now then, stand by your beds, let's have a look at this artist of yours, Blackadder. Next to me,
			Darling.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Thank you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Found someone for me, have you, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			General, I think I have - none other than young George here.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George looks suitably modest.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Bravo! Well, let's have a shufti then, shall we?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder takes out the picture he himself painted earlier.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's simply called War!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The painting is not good.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Damn silly title, George. Looks more like a couple of socks and a stick of pineapple to me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Permission to speak, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ahm ... I think not actually, Lieutenant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Quite right. If what happens when you open your mouth is anything like what happens when you
			open your paint box, we'll all be drenched in phlegm. This isn't what we're looking for at all,
			is it, Darling?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			No, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Next Blackadder takes out Baldrick 's painting.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			There is this, sir - it's Private Baldrick's. He's called it My Family and Other Animals.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Oh, good Lord, no.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, dear, well, I'm afraid that's really it, apart from this little thing.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes out Georges painting.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Ah, yes, now that's more like it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Who did this, Captain Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, actually, it was me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Permission to speak really quite urgently, sir!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Blast and damn your goggly eyes - stop interrupting, George! Now this is excellent.
			Congratulations, man. It's totally inspiring - makes me want to jump over the top and yell,
			Boo Sucks to you, Fritzy!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Are you sure you did this, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course I'm sure.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I'm afraid I don't believe you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			How dare you, Darling! General, I can't let that slur pass. What possible low, suspicious
			slanderous reason could this office boy have for thinking I didn't paint the picture?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Well, three reasons as a matter of fact. Firstly, you're in it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's a self-portrait.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Secondly, you told us you couldn't paint.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, one doesn't like to blow one's own trumpet.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Perm ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Denied.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Thirdly, it's signed ... 'George'.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder moves casually over to the painting and looks at it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well spotted. But not signed George - ahm - dedicated to George, King George. Gentlemen,
			the King!<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			The King! - Baldrick Where?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Bravo, Blackadder! I have absolutely no hesitation appointing you our official regiment's
			artist. You're a damn good man - not a pen-pushing, desk-sucking, blotter-jotter like
			Darling, here, eh, Darling!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			No, sir. Accompany us back to HQ immediately.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder gets his suitcase, which is already packed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Ten-shun!<br />
			<br />
			<i>George and Baldrick stand to attention as they leave.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Permission to jolly well speak right now, sir, otherwise I might just burst like a bally
			balloon!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Later, George, much later.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: STAFF HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Congratulations on your new appointment, Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			May I say, Blackadder, I am particularly pleased about it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Are you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Oh, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>But there is something very sinister about him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Now that you are our official war artist, we can give you the full briefing. The thing is,
			Blackadder, the King and Country cover story was just a cover story. We want you, as our
			top painting bod, to leave the trenches.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Tonight.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Suits me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			And go out into No Man's Land.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No Man 's Land?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not Paris?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			We want you to come back with accurate drawings of enemy positions.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You want me to sit in No Man's Land painting pictures of the Germans?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Precisely. Good man!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder starts to put his coat back on.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's a very attractive proposition, gentlemen, but unfortunately not practical. You see my
			medium is light - it'll be pitch dark. I won't be able to see anything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Good point - we'll send up a couple of flares! You'll be lit up like a Christmas tree for
			miles around.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Excellent, excellent - glad I checked.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: NO MAN'S LAND</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder, George and Baldrick are crawling through very dangerous-looking terrain.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right - total and utter quiet, do you understand? So, for instance, if any of us crawl
			over barbed wire they must on no account go (<i>screams</i>) Aaahhhhaaahh! (<i>Regaining himself</i>)<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Did you just crawl over some barbed wire, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, Baldrick, I've put my elbow in a blob of ice-cream.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Ah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now, where the hell are we?<br />
			<br />
			<i>George consults his map.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			We-e-ell, it's a bit difficult to say. We've crawled into an area marked with little mushrooms ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, and what do these symbols denote?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Uhm ... that we're in a field of mushrooms?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Lieutenant, that is a military map. It is unlikely to list interesting flora and fungi. Look
			in the key and I think you'll find those mushrooms aren't for picking.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Ah, yes, you're right, sir - it says 'mine' - so these mushrooms must belong to the man who
			made the map.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Either that or we're in the middle of a mine field.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, dear!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			So, he owns the field as well.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A star shell bursts and bathes them in light. Immediately the sound of machine-gunfire
			is heard.</i><br />
			<br />
			They're firing, sir! They're firing!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you, George ... if they hit me, you'll be sure to point it out, won't you? Now get on
			with your drawing and let's get out of here.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oughtn't we to wait for the flare, sir? You see, my medium is light ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Use your imagination, for heaven's sake.<br />
			<br />
			(<i>Sudden revelation</i>) Wait a minute - that's the answer.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I can't believe I've been so stupid.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, that is unusual, because I'm usually the stupid one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes, and I'm not over-furnished in the brain department.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, this time I've been the stupidest of all.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, now, sir - I won't have that. Baldrick and I will always be more stupid than you. Isn't
			that right, Baldrick? Stupid, stupid, stupid?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, yes - stupidy, stupidy, stupidy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			We're the stupidest stupids in the history of stupiditiness.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Machine-gunfire. They drop to the ground.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Finished? The obvious point is this: we'll go straight back to the dug-out and do the painting
			from there. You do the most exciting possible drawing of German defences from your imagination.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, that is a challenge!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well quite - whatever - come on, let's get out of here.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They start away.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, one thing, sir. If we should happen to tread on a mine, what do we do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, normal procedure is to jump 200 feet into the air and scatter yourself over a wide area.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Thank you, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: STAFF HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>George and Blackadder stand at attention. Melchett and Darling are inspecting the map. Now
			the entire German army is massed opposite Blackadder's trench.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Are you sure this is what you saw, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Absolutely. I mean there may have been a few more armament factories and not quite as many
			elephants, but ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Mmm. You know what this means?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			If it's true - we'll have to cancel the push.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Exactly ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh damn.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What a nuisance.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Exactly ... what the enemy would expect us to do, and therefore exactly what we won't do.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>High pitched</i>) Ah, now ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			If we attack them where their line is strongest, Fritz will think our reconnaissance is a
			total shambles. This will lull him into a false sense of security, and then next week, we can
			attack where the line is actually badly defended, and win the greatest victory since the
			Winchester flower-arranging team beat Harrow by 12 sore bottoms to one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Tell me, have you ever visited the planet Earth, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			So best fighting trousers on, Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Permission to yell 'Bravo' at an annoyingly loud volume, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Permission granted.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			BRAVO!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			That's the spirit, Lieutenant. Just your kind of caper, eh, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Good luck against those elephants.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and George enter. Baldrick has been cooking.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Get me a chisel and some marble, will you, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Taking up sculpture now, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, I thought I'd get my headstone done.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Really? What are you going to put on it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			'Here lies Edmund Blackadder - and he's bloody annoyed.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Are we going over, then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, we are, unless I can think of some brilliant plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			How about some rat au vin to help you think?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Rat au vin?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yeah, it's rat that's been ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick and Blackadder</b><br />
			Run over by a van.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, thank you, Baldrick. But that gives me an idea. Telephone, please.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: STAFF HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A candle-lit table is set with crystal goblets and salt and pepper, with china dishes
			and silver serving dishes. Darling and Melchett are finishing their main course and the
			pudding waits on a giant silver salver.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I suppose Blackadder and his boys will have gone over by now.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes - I' d give anything to be out there with them, dodging the bullets instead of sitting
			here drinking Château Lafite and eating these filets mignons with sauce béarnaise.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			My thoughts exactly, sir. Damn this Chateau Lafite!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes a nice big satisfied sip.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			He's a very brave man, Blackadder - and of course that Lieutenant of his - George - Cambridge
			man, you know. His uncle and I used to break wind for our college.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes a bite.</i><br />
			<br />
			Unusual taste this sauce béarnaise.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Yes. (<i>His face shows it tastes vile</i>) And to be quite frank, these mignons are a little,
			well ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Well, dungy ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			What on earth's wrong with the cook?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Well, it's a rather strange story, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, tell, tell.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I received a phone call this afternoon from Pope Gregory IX telling me that our cook has been
			selected for the English Cricket Team and must sail to the West Indies immediately.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			A moment later the phone rang again. It was a trio of wandering Italian chefs who happened to
			be in the area offering their services, so I had the quarter-master take them on at once.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett seems satisfied at this, and takes a bite of his pudding.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Jumping Jupiters! Are you sure these are raisins on the Plum Duff?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I'm sure they are, sir. Everything'll be all right when the cream custard arrives.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Blackadder, George and Baldrick with false moustaches and chefs' coats on after their
			night of catering at HQ.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, that was all jolly good fun, sir, but dash it all, we seemed to have missed the big push.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, damn, so we have. One thing puzzles me, Baldrick. How did you manage to get so much custard
			out of such a small cat?
