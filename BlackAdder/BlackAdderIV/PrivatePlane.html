			<b>SCENE ONE: THE TRENCH AND DUG- OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is early morning. There is a massive cannonade going on outside; it is drowning out the gramophone
			that Blackadder is listening to. He joins George outside in the trench.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God. Why do they bother?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			It's to kill Jerry, isn't it, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, but Jerry is safe underground in concrete bunkers. We've shot off over a million cannon shells and
			what's the result? One dachshund with a slight limp.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shouts out in the general direction of the shelling.</i><br />
			<br />
			Shut up!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The shelling suddenly stops and the music on the gramophone is heard clearly.</i><br />
			<br />
			Thank you. (<i>Then to George</i>) Right, I'm off to bed where I intend to sleep until my name changes to
			Rip Van Adder.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder goes back in and turns off the gramophone. There is a moment of beautiful peace. He sits on
			his bed, stretches and then lies down with a satisfying</i>
			<i>yawn. Instantly there is the huge noise of an aeroplane swooping overhead.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, God, bloody Germans, they can't take a joke, can they? Just because we take a few pot-shots at them,
			they have to have an air raid to get their own back.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The noise continues, along with the rattle of machine-guns. Blackadder gets up and puts on his helmet.</i><br />
			<br />
			Where are the air force? They're meant to defend us against this sort of thing.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is another burst of dangerous gunfire.</i><br />
			<br />
			Right, that's it. (<i>He grabs the phone and dives under the table with it</i>) Hello? Yes, I'd like to
			leave a message for the Head of the Flying Corps, please! To Air Chief Marshal, Sir Hugh Massingbird-Massingbird,
			VC DFC and bar, message reads, 'Where are you, you bastard?'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Here I am, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He is totally relaxed, despite the massive bombing outside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, for God's sake take cover.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Why's that, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Because there's an air raid going on, and I don't want to have to write to your mother at London Zoo and
			tell her that her only human child is dead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, all right, sir. (<i>He joins him hiding under the table</i>) It's just that I didn't
			know that there was an air raid going on.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The air raid stops.</i><br />
			<br />
			I couldn't hear anything above the noise of the terrific display by our wonderful boys of the Royal
			Flying Corps.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<i>George enters and hangs up his helmet.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I say! Those boys can't half thunder in their airborne steeds, can't they just!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He sees Blackadder and Baldrick under the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, what's going on here - a game of hide and seek? Excellent! I'll go away and
			count to a hundred, no, better make it five actually.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			George!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Oh, I see, it's sardines. Excellent. That's my favourite one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			George!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Yes, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder gets out from under the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Shut up and never say anything again as long as you live.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Right you are, sir. (<i>Pause</i>) Crikey, but what a show it was, sir. Lord Flashheart's Flying Aces.
			How we cheered when they dived, how we shouted when they spun, how we applauded when one chap got sliced
			in half by his own propeller. It's all part of the joke for those magnificent men in their flying machines.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			For 'magnificent men' read 'biggest show-offs since Lady Godiva entered the royal enclosure at Ascot
			claiming she had literally nothing to wear'. I don't care how many times they go up-diddly-up-up,
			they're still gits.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh - come on, sir. I'd love to be a flyer - up there where the air is clear.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The chances of the air being clear anywhere near you Baldrick are zero.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, but, sir, it'd be great, swooping and diving ... (<i>He flaps his hands by his head and makes an
			alarming noise</i>) Eeeeeeeeooowwww! Eeeeeoooow. Eeeow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, what are you doing?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm a Sopwith Camel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, it's a Sopwith Camel. I always get confused between the sound of a Sopwith Camel and the sound of
			a malodorous runt wasting everyone's time ... Now, if you can do without me in the nursery for a while,
			I'm going to get some fresh air.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He picks up his pipe and goes out into the trench. He is about to light the pipe when from behind
			him a glamorous, handsome man in flying gear suddenly attacks. It is Squadron Commander, the Lord
			Flashheart, and he throws Blackadder to the ground in a display of brilliant fighting. In an instant,
			his boot is on Blackadder's shoulder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Ha! Eat knuckle Fritz! How disgusting - a Boche on the sole of my boot! I shall have to find a patch
			of grass to wipe it on. Probably get shunned in the officers' mess ... 'Sorry about the pong, you
			fellows, trod on a Boche and just can't get rid of the whiff ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He lets Blackadder get up but keeps his gun pointed at Blackadder’s head.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Look, do you think we could dispense with the hilarious 'doggy doo' metaphor for a moment ... I'm not
			a Boche. This is a British trench.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Is it? Oh, that 's a bit of luck, thought I'd landed sausage-side. (<i>He puts his gun away</i>) Mind
			if I use your phone? If word gets out that I'm missing, 500 girls will kill themselves and I wouldn't
			want them on my conscience - not when they ought to be on my face!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He grabs the phone.</i><br />
			<br />
			Hi, Flashheart here. Cancel the state funeral, tell the king to stop blubbing! Flash is not dead! I
			simply ran out of juice and before all the girls start saying, 'oh what's the point of living any more',
			I'm talking about petrol! Woof! Woof! I've dumped the kite down on the proles ... so, send a car.
			General Melchett's driver will do, she hangs around with the big nobs, so she'll be used to a fellow
			like me! Woof! Woof!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Look, do you think you can make your obscene phone call somewhere else?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Flash ignores him totally.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			No, not in half an hour, you rubber desk johnny. Send the bitch with the wheels
			right now or I'll fly back to England and give your wife something to hang her towels on. (<i>He
			slams down the phone</i>) Okay, dig out your best booze and let's talk about me till the car comes!
			You must be pretty impressed, having Squadron Commander the Lord Flashheart drop in on your squalid
			bit of line!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Actually, no - I was more impressed by the contents of my handkerchief the last time I blew my nose.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Yeah? Like hell! You've probably got little piccies of me on the walls of your dug-out, haven't you?
			I bet you go all girly and giggly whenever you look at them.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah! I'm afraid not - unfortunately, most of the infantry think you're a prat. Ask them who they'd
			prefer to meet - Squadron Commander Flashheart or the man who cleans the public toilets in Aberdeen
			and they'd go for Wee Jock Poo-Pong McPlop every time.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Ha ha!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He biffs Blackadder on the nose and then enters the dug-out. Blackadder follows. Inside Baldrick
			and George are still discussing the display.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			When that fellow looped the loop, I honestly thought I'd ... (<i>He is stopped short, seeing Flash</i>)
			My God!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Yes, I suppose I am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Lord Flashheart! This is the greatest honour of my life! I hope I snuff it right now to preserve
			this moment for ever.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It could be arranged.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is totally thrilled.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Lord Flashheart! I want to learn to write so I can send a letter home about this golden moment.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			So all the fellows hate me, eh? (<i>Ruffling Baldrick's hair</i>) Not a bit of it. I'm your bloody
			hero, eh, old scout? Oh, Jesus!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He has got something extremely unpleasant on his hand gleaned from Baldrick's hair. He wipes it
			off on Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord. I've got every cigarette card they ever printed of you. My whole family took up smoking
			just so that we could get the whole set. My grandmother smoked herself to death so we could afford
			the album.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Of course she did, of course she did, the poor love-crazed octogenarian. Well, all right, you fellows,
			let's sit down and yarn about how amazingly attractive I am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, yes, if you'll excuse me, I have urgent business. There's a bucket outside I have to be sick
			into ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He leaves. Flashheart makes a sarcastic hoity-toity noise.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Whoooooooooh! All right, you chaps - right, let's get comfy. (<i>To Baldrick</i>) You look a decent
			British bloke, I'll park the old booties on you, if that's all right?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It would be an honour, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick kneels and Flashheart puts his feet up on Baldrick's back.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Of course it would. Have you any idea what it's like to have the wind rushing through your hair?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			No, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Flashheart breaks wind loudly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			(<i>Indicating Baldrick</i>) He has, lucky devil.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE DUG-OUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is later. Baldrick is in the same position, as he and George listen in rapt attention to
			Flashheart. Blackadder ostentatiously reads a book and ignores them.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			... so I flew straight through her bedroom window, popped a box of chocs on her dressing table,
			machine-gunned my telephone number into the wall and then shot off and shagged her sister ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>George claps his hands and guffaws. Bob, the driver, appears. She clears her throat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Driver Parkhurst reporting for duty, my lord ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Well, well, well, if it isn't little Bobby Parkhurst, saucier than a direct hit on a Heinz factory.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			I've come to pick you up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			That's how I like my girls - direct and to my point! Woof!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He grabs her hand and pulls her on to his lap.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Woof!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They kiss very noisily.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Gosh.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder looks at his watch.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Tally-ho, then, back to the bar.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He sweeps Bob up - she is kissing his shoulder.</i><br />
			<br />
			You know, you should join the Flying Corps, George ... that's the way to fight the war - tasty
			tucker, soft beds and a uniform so smart it's got a PhD from Cambridge ... You could even bring
			old breath-monster here. (<i>Breath-monster is Baldrick</i>) Anyone can be a navigator if they can
			tell their arse from their elbow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, that's Baldrick out I fear.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			We're always looking for talented types to join the Twenty Minuters.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And there goes George.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Tally-ho, Bobby! Hush, here comes a whiz bang, and I think you know what I'm talking about! Woof!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bob</b><br />
			Woof!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			God - it's like Crufts in here.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And Flash leaves, with Bob in his arms.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I say! What a splendid notion. The Twenty Minuters - soft tucker, tasty beds, fluffy uniforms! Not
			half!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Beggin' your permission, sir, but why do they call them the Twenty Minuters?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Now then, yes, this one's in my Brooke Bond Book of the Air, I think ... you have to collect all
			the cards you see and stick them in this wonderful presentation booklet ... (<i>He gets it out</i>)
			Ah, here we are: 'Twenty Minuters' - damn, I haven't got the card yet but the caption says, 'Twenty
			minutes is the average amount of time new pilots spend in the air.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Twenty minutes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			That's right.<br />
			<br />
			<i>For the first time in his life, George has Blackadder's total attention.</i><br />
			<br />
			Blackadder I had a twenty-hour watch yesterday with four hours' overtime. In two feet of water.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Then for goodness' sake, sir! Why don't we join?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yeh, it would be better than just sitting around here all day on our elbows.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, thank you. I've no desire to hang around with a bunch of upper-class delinquents, do twenty minutes'
			work and then spend the rest of the day loafing about in Paris drinking gallons of champagne and having
			dozens of moist, pink, highly experienced French peasant girls galloping up and down my - hang on ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>A very big thought occurs.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: MELCHETT'S HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling is sitting at the desk. Blackadder knocks on the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Come.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			Ah, Captain Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good morning, Captain Darling.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			What do you want?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You're looking so well.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I'm a busy man, Blackadder. Let's hear it, whatever it is.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You know, Darling, every man has a dream and when I was a small boy, I used to watch the marsh
			warblers swooping in my mother's undercroft and I remember thinking, 'Will men ever dare to do the
			same' ... And you know ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling realizes what Blackadder wants. He stands up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Oh, you want to join the Royal Flying Corps?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Casually</i>) That's a thought - could I?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			(<i>Equally casually</i>) No, you couldn't. Goodbye.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He sits down and goes back to work.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, Come on, Darling. Just give me an application form.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			It's out of the question. This is simply a ruse to waste five months in training after which you'll
			claim you can't fly after all because it makes your ears go 'pop'. Come on, I wasn't born yesterday,
			Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			More's the pity - we could start your personality from scratch. So, the training period is five
			months, is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			It's no concern of yours if it's five years and comes with a free holiday in Tunisia, and contraceptives
			supplied. Besides, they wouldn't admit you - it's not easy getting transfers, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He picks up his pencil and carries on writing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, you've tried it out yourself, have you?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling breaks his pencil lead. Blackadder has touched a nervy nerve.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			No, I have not.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Trust you to skive off to Some cushy option.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			There is nothing cushy about life in the Women's Auxiliary Balloon Corps.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder looks; Darling realizes he's let something out by mistake. General Melchett enters with
			George, who is in the middle of telling a rude joke.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			... so the Bishop said, 'I'm sorry, I didn't realize you meant an organist!'<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett laughs perfunctorily.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Thank you, George. At ease, everybody, now! (<i>He dumps a pile of files on the map</i>) Where's my map?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling hands it to him, and he unrolls it the wrong way round.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			God - it's a barren, featureless desert out there, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Other side, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hullo, George - what are you doing here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Me, sir? I've just popped in to join the Royal Flying Corps.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Hullo, Blackadder. What are you doing here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Me, sir? I've just popped in to join the Royal Flying Corps.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Of course, I said ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			'Bravo', I hope, Darling. You know sometimes I've had my doubts about you trenchy-type fellows, think
			there might be a touch of battle-dodging, nappy-wearing, 'I'd rather have a cup of tea than charge
			stark naked at Jerry' about you, but if you're willing to go up there with the Twenty Minuters, then
			you're all right by me, and welcome to marry my sister any day.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Sir, are you sure about this?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Certainly. You should hear the noise she makes eating a boiled egg, I'd be glad to get her out of the
			house. So report back here 0900 hours for your basic training.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: A ROYAL FLYING CORPS LECTURE ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and George are present with one or two other new recruits. There is a blackboard with a
			picture of a plane on it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Crikey, sir, I'm looking forward to today. Up diddly up, down diddly down, whoops, poop, twiddlydee -
			decent scrap with the fiendish Red Baron - bit of a jolly old crash landing behind enemy lines -
			capture, torture, escape, and then back home in time for tea and medals.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			George, who is using the family brain cell at the moment? This is just the beginning of the training -
			the beginning of five long, lazy months of very clever, very dull men looking at machinery.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a sound of screaming girls outside, followed by a familiar voice. Blackadder is not
			overjoyed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Hey, girls! Look at my machinery.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The girls scream even more and Flashheart enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			Enter the man who has no underwear! Ask me why.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all stand, enraptured.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Why do you have no underwear, Lord Flash?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Because the pants haven't been built yet that'll take the job on! That's the type of guy who's doing
			the training round here. Sit down. Well, well, if it isn't old Captain Slack Bladder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Couldn't resist it, eh, Slack Bladder? Told you, you thought I was great. Right let's do-o-o-o it!
			The first thing to remember is, always treat your kite like you treat a woman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			How d'you mean, sir? Do you mean take her home at the weekend to meet your mother?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			No, I mean get inside her five times a day and take her to heaven and back.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm beginning to see why the Suffragette Movement want the vote.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Any bird who wants to chain herself to my railings and suffer a jet movement (<i>another subtle thrust
			of the hips</i>) gets my vote. Right, that's it! See you in ten minutes for take-off.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He makes to leave.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hang on, hang on, what about the months of training?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Hey, wet pants, this isn't the Women's Auxiliary Balloon Corps, you're in the Twenty Minuters now!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling suddenly pops up at the back. He has an annoying smug look about him today.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Uh, sir, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Yes, prat at the back.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			I think we'd all be intrigued to know. Why are you called the Twenty Minuters?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Mr Thicko! Imagine not knowing that!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Simple, really - the average life expectancy of a new pilot is twenty minutes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Aha.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Not happy</i>) Life expectancy of twenty minutes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Right! Goggles on, chocks away - last one back's a homo. Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Flash goes. The other trainees follow him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We take off in ten minutes, we're in the air for twenty minutes, which means we'll be dead by
			twenty-five to ten.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Hairy blighters! This is a turn-up for the plus fours.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling strolls over, delighted.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Oh, I shouldn't worry about it too much, Blackadder. Flying's all about navigation. As long as you've
			got a good navigator, you'll be Fine.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He snorts and moves to the door. Baldrick enters in full flying gear - leather coat,</i>
			<i>flying goggles. Baldrick the navigator.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: THE SKIES OVER FRANCE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A flight of First World War planes soar through the skies. Blackadder’s voice is heard in the
			cockpit of one of the planes.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Actually, they're right - this is a doddle.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The plane dips dramatically.</i><br />
			<br />
			Whoops, a little wobble - but I'll get the hang of it. All right, Baldrick, time to take stock of our
			chances of survival - how many rounds have we got?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Five hundred, sir: cheese and tomato for you, rat for me.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George passes them in his plane.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Hello, sir. Tally bally ho!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What's this, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The plane soars upwards at an incredibly steep angle. Baldrick has hoisted himself up out of his
			seat and is balancing precariously with his arms outstretched.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, will you stop arsing about and get back in the cockpit?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Woohoo! Sir, I can see a pretty red plane from up here.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baron von Richthoven</b><br />
			(<i>For it is he</i>) Schnell, ah ha, ha.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, no. Watch out, Baldrick, it's stood right on our tail. Yes. This is developing into a distinctly
			boring situation. Luckily we're still on our side of the lines, so I'll crash land and claim my ears
			went 'pop' first time out.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Let's hope we fall on something soft.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Fine - I'll try and aim between General Melchett's ears.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The plane heads towards the earth then hits it with a terrible crash.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: A SINISTER GERMAN CELL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick and Blackadder are much dishevelled and in captivity.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I don't believe it! A German prison cell! For two and a half years the Western Front's been as likely
			to move as a Frenchman who lives next door to a brothel. Then, last night the Germans advance a mile
			and we land on the wrong side!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, dear, Captain B. My tummy's gone all squirty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's because you're scared, Baldrick, and you're not the only one. I couldn't be more petrified if
			a wild rhinoceros had just come home from a hard day at the swamp and found me wearing his pyjamas,
			smoking his cigars and in bed with his wife.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I've heard what these Germans do, sir, they'll have their wicked way with anything of woman born.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			In which case, Baldrick, you're safe. However, the Teutonic reputation for brutality is well founded.
			Their operas last three or four days and they have no word for 'fluffy'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I want my mum.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hmm, yes, it would be good to see her. I should imagine a maternally outraged
			gorilla would be a pretty useful ally when it comes to the final scrap.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They hear footsteps both ominous and sinister.</i><br />
			<br />
			Prepare to die like a man, Baldrick - or as close as you can get without actually shaving the palms
			of your hands ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>The door bursts open. A German officer enters - he is tough and sinister and sly and nasty.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Von Gerhardt</b><br />
			Good evening - I am Ober Leutnant von Gerhardt and I have a message for you
			from Baron von Richthoven, the greatest living German.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Which, considering the competition consists almost entirely of very fat men in leather shorts burping
			to the tune of 'She'll Be Coming Round The Mountain', is no great achievement.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Von Gerhardt</b><br />
			Quiet!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hits Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what is this message?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Von Gerhardt</b><br />
			It is 'Prepare for a fate vorse than death, English flyer fellow.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah. So it's the traditional warm German welcome.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Von Gerhardt</b><br />
			Correct! Also he is saying - 'Do not try to escape, or you will suffer even vorse.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A fate worse than a fate worse than death - that's pretty bad.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: MELCHETT'S HQ</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Darling and George are arguing over the desk. George is furious.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			It's all very well for you sitting behind a comfy desk.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			(<i>Also furious</i>) Don't take that tone with me, Lieutenant, or I'll have you on a charge for
			insubordination!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, I'd rather have a charge of insubordination than a charge of deserting a friend!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			How dare you talk to me like that!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett enters. He sees Darling and George arguing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Now then, now then, now then, now. Now then, then now, now then. What's going on?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			That damn fool Blackadder crashed his plane behind enemy lines and this young idiot wants to try
			and rescue him. It's a total waste of men and equipment.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			He's not a damn fool, sir, he's a bally hero.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			All right - I'll deal with this, Darling - delicate touch needed, I fancy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes a very godfatherly attitude and puts his arm round George.</i><br />
			<br />
			Now, George, do you remember when I came down to visit you when you were a nipper for your sixth
			birthday - you had a rabbit, beautiful little thing, do you remember?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Flossy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			That's right - and do you remember what happened to Flossy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			You shot him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			That's right. It was the kindest thing to do, after all he had been run over by that car.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			By your car, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, by my car, yes, but that too was an act of mercy after you remember that dog had been set on him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Your dog, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, yes, my dog. But what I'm trying to say, George, is the state that young Flossy was in after
			he'd been scraped off my front tyre is very much the state young Blackadder will be in now - if not
			very nearly dead then very actually dead.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George is very upset indeed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Permission for lip to wobble, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Permission granted.<br />
			<br />
			<i>George wobbles his lip.</i><br />
			<br />
			Stout fellow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Surely, sir, you must let me at least try to save him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			No, George, as pointless as trying to teach a woman the importance of a good forward defensive stroke.
			Besides, it would take a superman to get him out of there - not the kind of weed who blubs just
			because somebody gives him a slice of rabbit pie instead of birthday cake.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			I suppose you're right, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Course I am, sir. Now, let's talk about something more jolly, eh? Look, this is the amount of land
			we've recaptured since yesterday.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Totally distracted</i>) Oh, excellent.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They lean over the large map, a mixture of grass and earth.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			What's the actual scale on the map, Darling?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Uhm ... one to one, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Come again?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Ahm - the map is actually life size, sir. It's superbly detailed - look, there's a little worm.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Oh, yes. So, the actual amount of ground retaken is ... ?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Excuse me, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He jumps forward to measure the map.</i><br />
			<br />
			About seventeen square feet, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well - excellent. You see, Blackadder didn't die horribly in vain after all.<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			If he did die, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			That's the spirit, George! If nothing else works, a total pigheaded unwillingness to look facts in
			the face will see us through.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE GERMAN CELL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Baldrick are asleep. There is a clunk as the door unlocks and there stands the
			greatest of Germans - blond and mighty.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richthoven</b><br />
			Zo, I am the Red Baron von Richthoven. And you are der two English flyer aces responsible for the
			spilling of the precious German blood of many of my finest and my blondest friends. I have waited
			many months to do this.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He grabs Blackadder by the shoulders and then kisses him formally on both cheeks.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You may have been right, Balders - looks like we're going to get rogered to death after all.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Do you want me to go first, sir?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richthoven</b><br />
			Ha! You English and your zense of humour. During your brief stay I look forward to learning more of
			your vit, your punning and your amusing jokes about the breaking of the vind.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick's the expert there.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Certainly am, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richthoven</b><br />
			Ha! Ha! How lucky you English are to find the toilet zo amusing, for us it is a mundane and functional
			item, for you it is the basis of an entire culture.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all laugh - he hits Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			Silence! I must now tell you of the full horror of what avaits you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You see, Baldrick, dress it up in any amount of pompous verbal diarrhoea, the message is square heads
			down for the big Boche gang bang.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richthoven</b><br />
			As an officer and a gentleman you vill be looking forward to a qvick and noble death.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, obviously.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richthoven</b><br />
			But instead an even vorse fate avaits you. So, tomorrow you vill be taken back to Germany ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Here it comes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richthoven</b><br />
			To a convent school outside Heidelberg, vhere you spend zhe rest of zhe var teaching the young girls
			Home Economics.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Umm...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richthoven</b><br />
			For you, as a man of honour, the humiliation vill be unbearable!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think you'll find we're tougher than you imagine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richthoven</b><br />
			I can tell how much you are suffering by your long faces.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, but not suffering too much to say thank you. Say thank you, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Thank you, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richthoven</b><br />
			Ha, very amusing. But now - forgive me. I must take to the skies once again, the noble Lord
			Flashheart still eludes me!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think you'll find he's overrated - bad breath and ahm, impotent, they say.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richthoven</b><br />
			Ah, sexual innuendo. But enough of that - as you say in England - 'I must fly!' Ha ha! Perhaps I
			will master this humour after all!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I wouldn't be too optimistic.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richthoven</b><br />
			And ... (<i>At the door he stops coyly</i>) Uhm, the little fellow, if you get lonely in the night,
			I'm in the old Chateau ... there's no pressure.<br />
			<br />
			<i>As he is leaving, he trips over the stairs, and turns around with delight.</i><br />
			<br />
			Ha! Ha! A pratfall!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Is it really true, sir? Is the war really over for us?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The question finds Blackadder in the best mood of his life.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yup! Out of the war and teaching nuns how to boil eggs. For us, the Great War is finito, a war
			which would be a damn sight simpler if we just stayed in England and shot fifty thousand of our
			men a week! No more mud, death, rats, bombs, shrapnel, whiz bangs, barbed wire and bloody awful
			songs that have the word 'Whoops!' in the title. Damn, he's left the door open.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, good, we can escape.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Are you mad, Baldrick? I'll go and find someone to lock it for us.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a knock on the door. Blackadder sweeps it open. It is George, also in flying gear.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Shhhh! Cave! Mum's the word! Not half or what!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder slams the door shut on him in horror.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Why did you slam the door on Lieutenant George?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I can't believe it. (<i>He calls out through the door</i>) Go away!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			It's me - it's me!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He re-opens the door. There stands George, grinning.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What the hell are you doing here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			(<i>Very pleased with himself</i>) Oh, never mind the 'hows and whys'. And the 'do you mind if I
			don'ts'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But it would take a superman to get in here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Well, funny you should say that, because I did, in fact, have some help from a spiffing fellow.
			He's taken a break from some crucial top-level shagging.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Flashheart swings in through the door on a rope.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			It's me. Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Flashheart hits Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			God's potatoes, George! You said noble brother flyers were in the lurch. If I'd known it was only
			Slack Bladder and the mound of the hound of the Baskervilles, I'd have let them stew in their own
			juice. And let me tell you, if I ever tried that, I'd probably drown!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is up again and laughing. Flashheart hits him again.</i><br />
			<br />
			Still, since I'm here, I might as well doo-o-o it! As the bishop said to the netball team. Come on,
			chums!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They run away - then look back through the door. Blackadder has stayed behind. He sinks to the
			ground and starts moaning.</i><br />
			<br />
			Come on.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Uhm, look, sorry, chaps, but I've splintered my pancreas and I've got this awful cough.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He coughs. The coughs sound suspiciously like:</i><br />
			<br />
			Guards! Guards!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Wait a minute! I may be packing the kind of tackle you'd normally expect to find swinging about
			between the hind legs of a Grand National winner, but I'm not totally stupid - and I've got a
			feeling you'd rather we hadn't come.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, no, no. I'm really grateful but I'd slow you up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			I think I'm beginning to understand.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Are you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Just because I can give multiple orgasms to the furniture just by sitting on it doesn't mean I'm
			not sick of this damn war. The blood, the noise, the endless poetry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Is that what you really think, Flashheart?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Flashheart gets out a gun and points it at Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Of course ... it's not what I think! Now get out that door before I redecorate this room in an
			exciting new colour called Hint of Brain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Excellent - nice and clear. In that case, let's get back to that lovely war ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Woof!<br />
			<br />
			<b>George</b><br />
			Woof!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Bark!<br />
			<br />
			<i>But too late! Richthoven melodramatically appears at the doorway.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richthoven</b><br />
			Not so fast, Blackadder!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>With massive relief</i>) Damn - foiled again - what bad luck!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richthoven</b><br />
			Ah, and Lord Flashheart, this is indeed an honour. Finally the two greatest gentlemen flyers in
			the vorld meet. Two men of honour who have jousted together in the cloud-strewn glory of the skies
			are face to face at last. How often have I rehearsed this moment of destiny in my dreams. The valour
			we two encapsulate, the unspoken nobility of our comradeship, the ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>And Flashheart shoots him - 'bang'. He's dead now.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			What a poof! Let's go!<br />

			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />

			Hullo, Darling.<br />

			Hi, creep.<br />

			Flash, this is Captain Darling.<br />

			Captain Darling! Funny name for a guy, isn't it? The last person I called 'darling' was pregnant
			twenty seconds later. I hear you couldn't be bothered to help old Slackie here.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Darling</b><br />
			Oh, well, er, it wasn't that at all - we weighed up the pros and cons, and it didn't seem a reasonable
			use of our time and resources.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Flashheart</b><br />
			Well, this isn't a reasonable use of my time and resources, but I'm going to do it anyway.<br />
			<br />

			This.<br />
