			<H1>The Queen of Spain's Beard</H1>
			<b>SCENE ONE: FALCONBREAST CASTLE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is midnight and the moon is high. Two mysterious shrouded figures are up on the highest
			battlements. A dog barks far below them.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>And now the two figures have reached opposite ends of the same battlement: they sweep
			together and meet. The lady is passionate in her speech. The man is very passionate in his
			breathing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady</b><br />
			Oh, noble prince, your secret note of love has won my heart.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Deep excited breathing from the man.</i><br />
			<br />
			The castle of my body is yours by right of conquest. Come, let your tongue dive into the moat
			of my mouth, and your hands take possession of the ramparts of my plumpies. For I am yours,
			and yours alone.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She throws off her cowl, and is a beautiful brunette.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(For it is he)</i> And I yours!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He throws off his.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady</b><br />
			Urgh: Prince Edmund. I thought you were your brother.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She pushes him away in disgust. He topples over the battlement and is savaged by the savage
			dog below.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE KING'S WAR ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>In 1492, after the death of Randolph XII of Saxony and the collapse of the Treaty of Insects,
			Europe was in disarray. Kingdoms rose and fell; borders, even languages, changed; men were
			killed by their own side and women raped by soldiers of up to seven different nations every week.
			The Courts of Europe throbbed with activity, and none more so than England.<br />
			<br />
			The room is packed with globes, maps and military plans. On the floor is a map of Europe peopled
			with knee-high soldiers: the king and his lords are very busy. A messenger bursts in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			My lord: news! The Swiss have invaded France!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Excellent! Wessex: take 10,000 men and pillage Geneva.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Chiswick</b><br />
			But the Swiss are our allies, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Oh, yes. Well, get them to dress up as Germans. Chiswick, remind me to send flowers to the King
			of France in sympathy for the death of his son.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Chiswick</b><br />
			The one you had murdered?<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Yes, that's the fellow.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			My lord ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Will you get away from me!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Messenger rushes out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Ah, Harry, the gentle art of diplomacy! But you know, Harry, where real diplomacy starts, don't
			you, my boy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Actually I don't, my lord: but I'd like to know.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The king lifts up Prince Harry's skirt.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Here ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Are you sure, my lord? I can't imagine anything of real interest down there.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Very well: let me explain. What's this for, Harry?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Now he really is getting intimate.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Well, a couple of things.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Correct! And one of those things is ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Best not mentioned really.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Right! And the other is fornication, and without fornication there is no marriage, and without
			marriage there is no diplomacy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Oh, I see!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The king then kneels and points to the map.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			I have decided to ally to a nation most I threatening to France. The answer of course is Spain
			... the best way to cement an alliance of course is by marriage, that is why I have decided that
			you are to marry the Spanish Infanta.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The lords clap enthusiastically.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Actually, I don't think I can.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			What? Why not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			I am already engaged.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			What! Who to, boy?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry pulls out a list.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Princess Leia of Hungary, Grand Duchess Ursula of Brandenburg, Queen Beowulfa of Iceland,
			Countess Caroline of Luxembourg, Bertha of Flanders, Bertha of Brussels and Eunice of Estonia,
			Bernard of Saxe-Coburg ... <i>(Some mistake, surely)</i> Sorry, that should have been Bertha
			of Saxe Coburg ... And Jeremy of Estonia.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Damn! If I haven't got a son to marry her then the whole plan falls apart.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The lords look nervously at one another while the king studies the map, not to be disturbed.
			Chiswick finally takes courage.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Chiswick</b><br />
			Your Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			<i>(Snapping violently) Yes!</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Chiswick</b><br />
			You do have ... another son, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			What ... Oh, my God, you're right. Of course, the slimy one. What's his name?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Chiswick</b><br />
			Edmund, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Ah, yes, Osmond. Osmond can marry the Infanta. Then, with the Spanish alliance, we can massacre
			both the Swiss and the French!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Applause and cheers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lords</b><br />
			Huzzah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			By dividing them for us in two!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lords</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Preferably their top halves from their bottom halves!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lords</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund tends to the wounds from his earlier fall from the battlements. He has vicious dog
			bites along his neck. Percy and Baldrick enter.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Good morning, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Morning, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Good morning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My God. What happened to your neck?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah, yes. They are love bites actually.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Look more like dog bites to me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, yes. She was a bit of an animal.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Really, my lord. A fight to the death, eh?<br />
			Ha ha!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes. Well, as my tutor, old Bubbleface, used to say: make love and be merry, for tomorrow you
			may catch some disgusting skin disease.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He and Percy laugh heartily.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Actually, I'd be prepared to swear those were dog bites.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			They are not dog bites; she was very attractive.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What, shiny coat, wet nose, clear eyes ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, Baldrick, it was a woman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Fair enough, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Right, now that's sorted out. Percy, what are we up to today?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, my lord. First I thought that you and I might get out a couple of prisoners and ...
			actually I think Baldrick may have a point there, they do look rather like dog bites.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			All right, all right, they're dog bites, they're dog bites. I got bitten by a dog. Some woman
			pushed me off the top of a rampart because I am so hideously ugly and I got savaged by a
			rabid dog. Does that satisfy you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Right. Excellent. Good. Yes, Percy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Right, my lord. I thought we might ... so it wasn't a woman?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, it wasn't. It was a dog, it was a dog, it was a bloody great dog!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, right. Harry, of course, gets all the women.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Shut up. I never want women mentioned in my company again.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What about dogs?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Or dogs. Shut up you. I never want to see a woman again. If any woman tries to talk to me,
			warn her: the Black Adder is a venomous reptile and women are his prey.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Knock on the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			Enter; unless you're a woman, in which case, prepare to be thrown out of the window with your
			dog!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			My lord, I bring a message.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, obviously. You're a messenger.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			You are engaged to be married to the Infanta Maria of Spain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			My lord, I bring a message. You are ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, yes, yes, yes. Well, boys, did you hear that? I am to marry the Infanta of Spain!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes! Shall I go and tell her, my lord!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			The Black Adder is a venomous reptile and women and dogs ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, no, no! This is no ordinary woman. We're talking about a beautiful royal princess, Percy!
			Imagine what the Spanish Infanta must be like.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick and Percy</b><br />
			Howwwl!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund has rarely been more excited.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A crowd of people are gathered round to receive the Infanta. They are looking admiringly
			at Edmund, who is with Baldrick and Percy. Prince Harry approaches with a beauty on his arm.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			<i>Bienvenido a nuestro castillo-Espero que encuentras los desagües a su satisfacción.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ha ha ha ha. Mmm?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			It's Spanish. It means, 'Welcome to our castle, and I hope you find the drains to your
			satisfaction.' Here you are. I've jotted it down for you. It should help you break the ice
			with the Infanta. I don't think you've met Countess Caroline of Luxembourg.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Hello, Caroline.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Actually, I've only just met her myself. Excuse me. <i>Bienvenue a notre chateau, Caroline.
			J'espère que vous trouvez satisfaisant le robinet de purge.<br />
			<br />
			Prince Harry moves away.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ha ha: Luxembourg.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Have you ever seen a man so obviously seething with jealousy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, I haven't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Seethe, seethe, seethe, my lord. If he goes on seething like that much longer, he'll turn
			into a seethe.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Baldrick, what are you talking about?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			My lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, what is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			They say the Infanta's eyes are more beautiful than the famous stone of Galveston.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			The what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			The famous blue stone of Galveston, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What's that exactly?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ah, well, my lord. It's a famous blue stone, and it comes from Galveston.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I see. And what about it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, the Infanta's eyes are bluer than it, my lord, for a start.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I see. Have you ever seen this stone?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ahm, not as such, my lord, no. But I know a couple of people who have and they say it is
			very blue indeed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I see. And have these people seen the Infanta's eyes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I shouldn't think so, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And neither have you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			No, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			So, what you're telling me is that something that you have never seen is slightly less blue
			than something else you have never seen?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a polite fanfare and the Infanta enters. She is an extraordinarily capacious
			woman. A dragon. But a dragon who is sure she is the most attractive woman in Europe, and
			the most sensual in the world. She is instantly, passionately, in love with Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			Accompanying her is her interpreter, a thin weaselly cove with a beard, called Don
			Speekingleesh.<br />
			<br />
			Edmund carries on regardless of her presence.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Percy, in the end, you are about as much use to me as a hole in the head, an affliction with
			which you must be familiar, never having had a brain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			Hello.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Hello. <i>(And he turns back to Percy)</i> Here I am awaiting the arrival of the most
			ravishing ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>The interpreter and the Infanta have approached Edmund, the interpreter closest to him,
			the Infanta behind him, so the latter is largely blocked from Edmund's view.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			Hello.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Look, leave me alone, will you. I'm trying to talk to someone.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund continues talking to Percy.</i><br />
			<br />
			... While you're wittering away like a pox-ridden parakeet ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Eres el verdadero amor de mi vida. Amor mío amor mío ...<br />
			<br />
			The interpreter translates the Infanta's whispers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			You are the true love of my life: my love, my love ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Tu eres mi unico amor. Quiero besarte y abrazarte ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			You are the only one for me. I want to hug and kiss you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund bops him on the nose.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Soy la Infanta ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			No, I am the Infanta!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What! No one told me you had a beard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			It	must be Jeremy of Estonia!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>(Grabbing him) Non! Soy la Infanta!<br />
			<br />
			The horror of realization hits Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, absolutely. Waah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>He esperado este momento toda mi vida.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			I have waited for this moment all my life.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Tu nariz es más pequena de lo que esperaba.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			Your nose is smaller than I expected.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I have suffered no similar disappointment.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			<i>(To Infanta) No he sufrido igual desengaño.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			Amor mio ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			My love, my love.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Infanta makes a grab for Edmund and launches into the most passionate kiss in the
			history of European love. Edmund tugs and pulls and finally breaks free: a broken man.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Me gustan tus labios.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			Your lips I like.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Es el resto de tu cuerpo lo que me interesa.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			It is the rest of your body I wish to find out more about.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Infanta gives Edmund her killer look of lust and desire: he is frozen with horror.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: THE WAR ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger One</b><br />
			My lord, news.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger One</b><br />
			Your Highness! The Spanish Infanta has arrived!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Ah! Good news! Soon we will have Spain in our grip!<br />
			<br />
			<i>A second messenger rushes in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger Two</b><br />
			My lord, news!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger Two</b><br />
			The King of France sends his greetings.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Ah! Good news! My diplomacy triumphs!<br />
			<br />
			<i>A third messenger rushes in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger Three</b><br />
			My lord, news!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger Three</b><br />
			Lord Wessex is dead!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Ah! This news is not so good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger Three</b><br />
			Pardon, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			I like it not: bring me some other news.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger Three</b><br />
			Pardon, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			I like not this news! Bring me some other news!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger Three</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He exits and the king returns to the map. Messenger Three re-enters immediately.</i><br />
			<br />
			My lord, news!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger Three</b><br />
			Lord Wessex is not dead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Ah, good news. Let there be joy and celebration: let jubilation reign!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger Three</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Oh, yes, and tell Osmond that to further strengthen ties with Spain, he marries tomorrow!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund sprints into his room and locks the door. Baldrick and Percy are with him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, my God. In twenty-four hours I'll be married to a walrus.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord: you can't just lock her out, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, you're right. But it should hold her for at least a minute.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He leaps on to his bed and tugs a small rope. A little portcullis crashes down in front
			of the door. Baldrick produces an axe from under the bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Wait a moment, my lord! I think I may have a plan to get you out of this marriage.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yeees: but it's going to be a stupid one, Percy, let's face it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy thinks for a while.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, you're right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Still ... tell me what it is anyway.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Actually, no, my lord. I don't think I'll bother.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, go on. Please tell me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			All right. I go to the Infanta's room and tell her that you've gone mad. She comes to the
			door, and you meet her, disguised as a little pig. But then, and this is the cunning bit,
			instead of saying 'oink, oink', you say 'moo'!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, then she'll know you're mad, and leave.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			You were right. You shouldn't have bothered.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I also have a plan, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Why not ... make her think you prefer the company of men?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, I do Baldrick, I do.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, my lord, I mean, the ... intimate company ... of men.<br />
			<br />
			<i>It dawns on Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			You don't mean ... like the Earl of Doncaster!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I mean just like the Earl of Doncaster!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			That great radish, that steaming great left-footer. The Earl of Doncaster, Baldrick, has
			been riding side-saddle since he was seventeen.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But who would marry the Earl of Doncaster?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, no one ... Brilliant! Of course! No one would marry the Earl of Doncaster. Except
			perhaps the Duke of Beaufort. Quick - what are we going to do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			First I'll get you looking right. We just need something effeminate draped round your
			shoulders.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Either of the Beaufort twins would do.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund is now dressed absurdly in extravagant, colourful clothing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Right, perfect. Now, all we need to do is practise with Percy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Very suspicious)</i> Practise what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Presentation, my lord. Percy, you stand over here and my lord, just there. Now, Percy, Lord
			Edmund is going to try and make himself attractive to you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Attractive?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			You know. Like the Earl of Doncaster.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Good Lord. Oh, well, fair enough.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy immediately clicks into his perfect imitation of the famous earl.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, Percy, you act normally. I'm the Earl of Doncaster. Right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Right. Go.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund tries imitating, but in vain.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, I can't do this. It's impossible.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Never mind. I've got a couple more things might help.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Percy. what am I going to do?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick leaves in search of more props. Percy and Edmund stand awkwardly, Edmund still
			half trying to get into character.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Perhaps we should try to strike up a conversation ... Hello there.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Hello ... Er ... how are you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Very camp)</i> I'm fine. Have you heard? Prince Edmund's going to marry the Spanish
			Infanta.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund physically attacks Percy for this obviously provocative comment.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, he damn well isn't, and anyone who suggests otherwise is going to have his head torn off.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He gets Percy flat on his face in a compromising position. Baldrick re-enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, that's the kind of thing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Standing like a man posing for a painting in the middle of the hall, Edmund is fully
			dressed in his campest regalia: Percy is acting it too, and Baldrick is fussing round,
			just fixing those crucial little details. Trumpets blow.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Here she comes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They stand to further attention. The king enters. He is en route to the war room and
			isn't at all shocked by this sight.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Morning, Doncaster. Chiswick, take this to the Queen of Naples.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The king hands Chiswick a vase.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Chiswick</b><br />
			What is it, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			The King of Naples.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They exit.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Quick ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>The doors open and Prince Harry enters with another beautiful princess on his arm. He
			looks at Edmund vaguely askance.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, my God.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Some lark for the stag party, eh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, that's right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			I don't think you have met the Grand Duchess Ursula of Brandenburg?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, hello. How do you do, Ursula.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Look, I did just want to have a word about my speech at the wedding. I thought perhaps I'd
			go for a fruit motif.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Something like this: 'It is with exstrawberry pleasure that we welcome you. May you be the
			apple of your husband's eye, and may he in turn cherries you' - cherish, you see - 'even
			though it is an orange'd marriage.' What do you think?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Brilliant, brilliant, quite brilliant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes, I think it is rather good. I'm actually hoping to squeeze in a banana by the end of the
			day. <i>Willkommen nach unser Schloss, Ursula.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry and Ursula exit. Trumpets blow.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			OK, my lord. This is it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen pops her head round the corner.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			For Christ's sake, mother: what do you want?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Nothing, nothing.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen halts as the doors fling open and the Infanta enters with the interpreter. She
			sees Edmund; in a second she is sobbing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			It's working, it's working!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Te abrazo y te amo totalmente.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			Oh, I embrace you and love you totally.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Qué amor es éste que te dizfrazas como un espanol para complacerme.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			Oh, what a love this must be, that you dress like a Spanish man to delight me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>0, qué amor, o, que amor.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			Oh, what a love, oh, what a love.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Baldrick, you fool.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Infanta embraces Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, look at the two lovebirds ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Over the Infanta's shoulder)</i> One lovebird, and one love elephant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			It's almost as if they were married already.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Suddenly alert)</i> What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			It's almost as if you were married already.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			That's what I thought you said.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He wrestles round to a different angle so he can speak to Baldrick and Percy.</i><br />
			<br />
			Boys.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy and Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I think I have another plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: A CORRIDOR</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The Reverend Lloyd is walking along Innocently when he is knocked unconscious by a stick
			wielded by Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: A PEASANT'S COTTAGE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A quintessential wishy-washy clergyman, the Reverend Lloyd, has made a makeshift altar
			out of a table in this peasant's cottage: he is assembling his artefacts for a wedding service,
			and rubbing his head where he was hit: he looks a little insecure. As he potters, we hear
			voices and a woman, Mrs Applebottom, giggling.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Percy, is she the best you could do? I mean, I am marrying the woman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, but it is only for a couple of days, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, yes, I suppose so. Come on, hurry up, Father.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Reverend</b><br />
			Very well. We are gathered here, 0 gracious Lord, to bear witness, at very short notice<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund is standing next to Tully Applebottom, a solid peasant woman. Percy and Baldrick
			flank the odd couple.</i><br />
			<br />
			... to the marriage of these two God-fearing Christians, Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh, and ...
			<i>(consulting a piece of paper)</i> Tully Applehottom. Is that right?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Tully Applebottom</b><br />
			<i>(Giggling)</i> Yes, that's right. Who ever would have thought it? The Duke of Edinburgh,
			consumed with passion, whisks away little Tully ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Shut up. <i>(She giggles: Edmund turns to the reverend)</i> Come on, get on with it, Father.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Reverend</b><br />
			Very well. Are you Prince Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, I'm a bowl of soup. For goodness' sake, hurry up!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Loud giggles from Tully.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Reverend</b><br />
			And are you Miss Tully Applebottom?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Tully Applehottom</b><br />
			Mrs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Reverend</b><br />
			Mrs. Ah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ah!<br />
			<br />
			<i>A moment's silence.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes. Well? Get on with it, Father.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Reverend</b><br />
			But surely if she's ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, for heaven's sake, the Church is never going to progress if it isn't a bit adaptable.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Reverend</b><br />
			Yes, but this is very unusual ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick places a knife at his throat.</i><br />
			<br />
			Although hasn't the Church always dealt with the unusual? The miracle with the fishes, for
			example. We continue ... Does ... anyone here ... know any just cause or impediment why
			these two should not be joined together in holy matrimony?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			No!<br />
			<br />
			<i>At which moment a door swings open and a large peasant with a scythe enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Applebottom</b><br />
			Yes!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Reverend</b><br />
			Ah, and you are ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Applebottom</b><br />
			Mr Applebottom.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Reverend</b><br />
			Are you the father of the bride?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Applebottom</b><br />
			No, Fm the husband of the bride.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Applebottom</b><br />
			This is my husband Thomas. Thomas, this is my fiancé, the Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Edmund,
			this is Thomas; Thomas, this is Father ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Reverend</b><br />
			Smith, I called about the ducking stool fund.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mr Applebottom moves threateningly towards Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			The thing is, I was just wondering.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Applehottom</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mr Applebottom has them all cornered by the altar.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Whether I could have a temporary arrangement with your good lady. I only need her for a very
			short stint.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Applebottom</b><br />
			Get out of here.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Look, you stupid peasant. All I want to do is marry your wife.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Applehottom</b><br />
			Get out.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund leaves, without ceremony or dignity or wife.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Applebottom</b><br />
			That was the Duke of Edinburgh, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Applebottom</b><br />
			Ah, no. That would be the Earl of Doncaster.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: BAY WINDOW OF THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The Infanta, interpreter and queen are having a 'get-to-know-you' session.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Ah, esto está bien.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			Well, this is nice.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Hablemos un poco de cosas de mujeres.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			To have a little talk about ladies' things.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Las dos solas.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			Just the two of us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Bueno. Hábleme de los hombres ingleses, senora.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			So tell me, Mrs Queen. about Englishmen.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, they spend most of their time with animals, you know, and other men: and when they
			do come to the women, they only want one thing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Qué?</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			And what is that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, it's a kind of pudding made with bread and butter and raisins. That and ... the
			other thing, of course.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Y qué es so?</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			What is the other thing?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, custard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			<i>Crème.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Y Edmundo, qué tal es?</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			And Edmund, now what's he like?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, I told you, this pudding ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>No, no, en la cama.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			No, what's he like ... in bed?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, I see. Well, in bed he likes hot milk, with just a little cinnamon.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			No. What. Is. He. Like?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, he's like a little rabbit really, isn't he?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Infanta</b><br />
			<i>Mamá, mama cuánto le quiero!</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Interpreter</b><br />
			Oh, mummy, mummy: how much I love him!<br />

			<i>Nothing can put this woman off</i><br />

			<b>SCENE TWELVE: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund is wearing a large set of stag horns on his head. Percy and Baldrick are wearing
			them as well. There is a roasting stag in front of the fire.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I would never have believed that my stag party would be like this ... the most depressing
			night of my life.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, at least you can take solace in one thing, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What's that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You can be pretty sure your wife's a virgin.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			At least, there are no living witnesses to the contrary. If she wasn't we might still stand
			a chance. Officially you've still got to be a virgin.<br />
			<br />
			<i>An idea hits Edmund. He looks at Percy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			What, my lord? <i>(He suddenly realizes)</i> Oh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They both look across at Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, no, my lord. No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, yes, <i>yeees!</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>This is the definitive plan.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THIRTEEN: A CORRIDOR</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund, Percy and Baldrick stand in a dark corridor outside the Infanta's room.
			Baldrick's coat is removed, as before execution.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord, please, I beg you to reconsider.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			If there were any other way, Baldrick, you know I'd take it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But I'll die in there.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, and we'll give you a hero's funeral: bury you at sea; say you died in combat with an
			enemy vessel. Right, in you go. Little boy with big job to do. Percy, let's get the king.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy turns to follow Edmund, but stops, turns again and goes slowly to Baldrick. They
			hug ceremonially, like men before a battle. Tears shed, Percy leaves.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOURTEEN: THE INFANTA'S ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters the pitch darkness of the Infanta's room.</i><br />

			Infanta ... Infanta.<br />

			<i>Ooooooo! Edmundo, amor mb.</i><br />

			My lord, your Majesty!<br />

			<b>King</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I bring the gravest of news!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			What? Our armies on the Rhine slaughtered, their heads cut off and melted cheese poured
			down their nostrils in the traditional Swiss manner?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIXTEEN: THE TNFANTA'S ROOM</b><br />

			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Well, what then?<br />
			<br />

			<i>(His most grand manner)</i> My lord: the Spanish Infanta is not a virgin.<br />

			What?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			The Infanta I am to marry tomorrow is not a virgin.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Oh, yes. I know, her uncle told me ... We took five hundred off the dowry because of it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			But I thought ...<br />

			Only one of you has to be a virgin. Anything else?<br />

			Marriage is an holy state, conceived by God ...<br />
			<br />

			... so if any man here knows just cause why they should not be married, let him speak now,

			Oh, my love, save me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Sorry, what can I do? Politics.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shrugs his happy shoulders.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Come on, come on. Where is she?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund smooths his hair and strikes an attractive pose.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Through the crowd walks the very young and beautiful Princess Leia. She is very young
			indeed. Maybe just ten.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund's face registers surprise. The trumpets accompany the little girl's walk to where
			Edmund is. They stand facing each other, all others having moved away to give space for
			this romantic meeting.</i><br />
			<br />
			Ah, good. Osmund, meet your new wife.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Leia</b><br />
			Hello, Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Hello, Leia.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Leia</b><br />
			Are we getting married now?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Er, yes I believe we are.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Leia</b><br />
			Come on then!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Archbishop</b><br />
			Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-TWO: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>There are now two single beds in Edmund's room. Princess Leia is in one, Edmund is in
			the other, reading a book. Princess Leia is listening intently.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And so it came to pass that the Big Bear had to leave all his friends in the wood, and go
			to live in a land far away, where the fairies and the elves would look after him until the
			day he died.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund closes the book. The princess yawns.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Leia</b><br />
			Oh, that was lovely, Edmund. What a happy story. Isn't it time to put the light out?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, my dear, I think it is. It must be at least six o'clock.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund blows the candle out between the beds.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Leia</b><br />
			Goodnight, Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Wearily)</i> Goodnight, my dear.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund emits a deep sigh.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Leia</b><br />
			Can I have a drink of water please?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, yes, all right.
