			<b>SCENE ONE: THE DUKE OF WINCHESTER'S BEDCHAMBER<b></b></b><br />
			<br />
			<i>England, November, 1487. The battle between the Church and the Crown continues to rage and the Duke of Winchester, the greatest landowner in England, is dying.<br />
			<br />
			The duke lies in bed. The Archbishop of Canterbury is on one side of the bed, the king on the other, both holding his hands. Behind the king stands Lord Tavis, in a spiked helmet. Other lords and doctors look on.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Duke</b><br />
			Dying. my lords, am I dying?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Archbishop</b><br />
			Never!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Never!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Archbishop</b><br />
			And yet, my son, to pass away the idle hours until your recovery ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>The duke has an almost terminal spasm, which speeds the archbishop up a bit.</i><br />
			<br />
			... let us imagine you yourself were to pass away: to whom would you leave your lands?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They both produce pre-written wills they are keen the duke should sign.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Why, to me! Of course.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He holds his will under the dukes nose.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Duke</b><br />
			Yes: to my beloved king.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The duke prepares to sign the will. The king guides his hand.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Archbishop</b><br />
			I hope then your filthy soul is prepared for hell, my son.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Duke</b><br />
			Hell?!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The king glares at the archbishop.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Archbishop</b><br />
			Yes, hell, where Satan belches fire and enormous devils break wind both night and day.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Duke</b><br />
			Alas!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Archbishop</b><br />
			Hell, where your mind is never free from the torments of remorse and your bottom never free from the pricking of little forks.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Duke</b><br />
			No, spare me the little forks!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He reaches for the archbishop's will.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			What is this nonsense?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Archbishop</b><br />
			Hell, where the softest bits from your nether regions are everyone else's favourite lunch.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Duke</b><br />
			<i>(Stabbing pain in his chest)</i> Alas! Argh! Forgive me, noble sire: I will change my will and leave my lands to the Church!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The will comes out from the archbishop. The duke signs it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			What?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Archbishop</b><br />
			Blessed be thy stainless soul.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			You will change your mind later, I know it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And the duke dies.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Archbishop</b><br />
			I think not.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The king is very cross about this indeed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE BAY WINDOW OF THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund and Percy are, as usual, doing very little.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah, Baldrick, what news?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, my lord, an informed source tells me that the Duchess of Gloucester has given birth to twin goblins.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, no, no. About the Duke of Winchester.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, he's still hanging on.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			He must be on his last legs by now, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Tssk:	how many sets of legs has the man got? Really, I wish he'd make up his mind: either he dies, or he lives for ever. It's this shilly-shallying that's so undignified.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A messenger enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			My lord, I come with tragic news.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What, died at last, has he?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			Who, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, I see. Now the idea is that you ask me what the message is before you tell it to me. Quite brilliant, I must say. I was referring to the Duke of Winchester.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			Who, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Right, now let's try and sort this out in words of one syllable, shall we? Someone has died, yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Who is it that has died?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			The Archbishop of Canterbury, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Are you a cretin?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, dear. The Archbishop of Canterbury, eh? The king has done it again. That's the third this year. How did this one die?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			Horribly, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Any details?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			Ah, no: 'horribly' was all I was given.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			My lord, I come with tragic news .<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			I've heard it - will you go away. Edmund, the Archbishop of Canterbury has met with a most tragic accident and there seems to be some confusion but I think I've fathomed out how it came about.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, I think I've got a pretty shrewd idea myself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Apparently, Archbishop Godfrey had just come out of the Duke of Winchester's room ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Who had just died leaving all his lands to the Church?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Well, as a matter of fact, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And so the king was really out for his blood presumably.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			I dare say. Anyway the point is at that moment Sir Tavis Mortimer.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			The king's hired killer?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			No, no. Mortimer, that tall, rather striking fellow with no ears.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, that's him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Well, he came round the corner, saw the archbishop, rushed towards him with his head bowed in order to receive his blessing - and unfortunately killed him stone dead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			How?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Mortimer was wearing a Turkish helmet.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			One of those things with a two-foot spike coming out of the top?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes, the ones they normally use for butting their enemies in the stomach and killing them stone dead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Presumably he had forgotten he was wearing it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes, that's right. A tragic accident.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Almost as tragic as Archbishop Bertram being struck by a falling gargoyle whilst swimming off Beachy Head.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes, or Archbishop Wilfred slipping and falling backwards on to the spire of Norwich Cathedral. The Lord works in mysterious ways - I just don't know how I'm going to break it to his catamite.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry moves away. Percy is mortified by all this bitter news.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			What a tragic accident, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Accident, my codlings.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund, Percy and Baldrick are sitting in front of the fire warming their hands.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Who do you think will take over?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, it'll be one of those bishop fellows, I should imagine. They tend to go for religious types.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes: rumour has it, my lord, that the king wants to choose Prince Harry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, really.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			<i>(With deep meaning)</i> Prince Harry, archbishop, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Good lord! Prince Harry, archbishop -and we all know what happens to archbishops, don't we?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, they go to Canterbury.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, you fool, I mean ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He does a slitting throat action.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, yes!<br />
			<br />
			<i>So does he. All three laugh gleefully.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Are you sure about your source, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, it was Jane Smart: she was the one who told me about the Duke and Duchess of Kent and the chocolate chastity belt.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, with Harry gone - the Black Adder will be king next.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Another gleeful laugh. All three pretend to slit their throats.</i><br />
			<br />
			Today could be one of the most important days of my life. I want my most splendid garments for the ceremony.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Certainly, my lord. Hat, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			The Trojan, I think.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Boots, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			The Italian.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			And codpiece, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Let's go for the Black Russian, shall we? It always terrifies the clergy. <i>They laugh. It is a great day.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>People are gathered for the announcement of the new archbishop. Edmund is wearing a black helmet with a plume, boots with toes so long they attach to the knee with a golden chain, and a very large black codpiece.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Any further rumours, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Not really, my lord. Apparently Lord Wilders is keeping a sheep in his bedroom, but nothing on the appointment, no.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Fair enough.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen comes across to talk to her son, as a bishop faints at the sight of his cod-piece.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Why are you dressed like this, Edmund?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Like what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, this enormous nonsense here.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She pats the codpiece and walks on to the throne as trumpets blow and the king enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah, fingers crossed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Members of the court and clergy, I have, at last, after careful consultation with the Lord God, his son Jesus Christ and his insubstantial friend, the Holy Ghost, decided upon the next archbishop. May he last longer in his post than his predecessors.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Fat chance.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			I appoint to the Holy Seal of Canterbury my own son ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>A trumpet blows.</i><br />
			<br />
			Edwin, Duke of Edinburgh.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(In total panic)</i> Eurgh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Archbishop, we salute thee.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Everyone kneels except Percy, who goes to shake Edmund's hand.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Congratulations, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund angrily gestures Percy to kneel. Then he takes a hat from a kneeling bishop and covers his now slightly unsuitable enormous codpiece with it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: SECTION OF THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The king and Prince Harry are kneeling and arm wrestling over a stool.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Keep going! Keep going! Use both hands if you want to. Very good. Well done, Harry.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a polite knock at the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Excuse me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Enter.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Your Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund enters politely: he has changed into modest attire with a tiny codpiece.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Ah, my Lord Archbishop.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes. There were just a couple of points about my appointment before things are really firmed up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, firstly, could I ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			No, you couldn't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Secondly, I was wondering ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Don't misunderstand this appointment, Egbert. I have always despised you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, you are my father, of course. I mean you're biased.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			You, compared to your beloved brother Harry, are as excrement is compared to cream.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			My lord, you flatter me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And me also, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			So now, my boy, when I have at last found a use for you, don't try to get out of it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, no, my lord. Certainly not, no. I just wondered whether perhaps another man, equally weak-willed and feeble, might do just as well.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Ha! There is no such man.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, of course not, silly me. I thought perhaps someone <i>(casually)</i> who believed in God ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			No, no, no. If I needed someone who believed in God, I'd have chosen Harry ... not an embarrassing little weed like you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, well, I think that's everything cleared up then. Goodness, almost time for evensong: must be going.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Egbert, come here.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He beckons Edmund towards him and gets hold of him by the throat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Archbishop. A word of advice. If you cross me, now or ever, I shall do unto you what God did unto the Sodomites, understand?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He lets Edmund go.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Good, good. I shall make myself available for all eventualities. Thank you so much.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund goes out into corridor. He is crazed with panic, pressed to the wall.</i><br />
			<br />
			Flee!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: THE CASTLE COURTYARD</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Early morning. It is very cold. Edmund stands in front of a loaded cart with Baldrick and Percy. They are fully prepared to steal quietly away ... for ever.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			We've got the thumb screws, the foot crusher, the nose hooks, those long rods ... Where's the dwarf?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dwarf</b><br />
			<i>(From under a sheet)</i> Here, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Right, let's go.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He goes round the corner and comes slap bang upon the king, Lord Chiswick and Prince Harry.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Archbishop!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah! Hail!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Going somewhere?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahm ... yyyyes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Where?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Canterbury.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Good. Prince Harry here will accompany you. I would hate to see you murdered before your investiture.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Chiswick, fresh horses!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy has not been paying attention, unfortunately.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			My lord, if we are going to catch the boat to France, we'll have to hurry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			The boat to France?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahm ... You off to France, Percy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I thought we all were.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, Harry and I are off to Canterbury, aren't we, Harry?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, I see. You've changed your plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, no, not really. The only change is, perhaps, Percy, if you could go and put your face in some manure and then follow along at a reasonable distance. That will be fine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: ON THE WAY TO CANTERBURY</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund and Prince Harry are riding along, with Percy, Baldrick and the luggage following behind.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			And another thing. What bothers me, your Grace, is suppose my right hand offends me and I cut it off - what happens if my left hand offends me as well, I mean what do I cut it off with?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes. That is a knotty one.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They pass two workmen, called Cain and Abel.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Cain</b><br />
			Who was that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Abel</b><br />
			I don't know, but that tall fellow had a face full of manure.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cain</b><br />
			That's what I call style.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE ALTAR OF A GREAT CATHEDRAL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund is kneeling in full regalia before a large bishop. The king sits on a throne nearby.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Do you, Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh, believe in God the Father.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund makes to answer, but suddenly realizes there is more to come. </i><br />
			<br />
			God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund checks his answer with the king, who nods vigorously.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahm, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			I then name thee Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of all England.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The music swells and the nearby incense burner swings more enthusiastically: its smoke gets to Edmund who sneezes, with extraordinary violence, then wipes his nose on the vestments of a bishop. A good start to his Primacy.<br />
			<br />
			As the ceremony draws to a close, Edmund, Percy and Baldrick set off down the aisle. Edmund is swinging the incense, but rather too enthusiastically. Two people fall over, and he lets go of it, and it flies out of his hand. He looks anxious. It is not an auspicious beginning.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: THE CLOISTERS OF THE CATHEDRAL</b><br />
			<br />
			His Investiture over, Archbishop Edmund the Unwilling swiftly adopted the ways of the cloth. But ever the shadow of his father's threat hung over him, until at last one day.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund and Baldrick are walking through cloisters. Edmund is in his purple robes. Baldrick is in a simple monk's sackcloth.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Tell me, Brother Baldrick: exactly what <i>did</i> God do to the Sodomites?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm not sure, my lord. Though it is hard to imagine it was anything worse than what they did to each other.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Mmmmmmm.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He walks round the corner and straight into a knight who is wearing a pointy hat.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, my God.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund is sure he is facing certain death. The messenger pulls out what he thinks will be a sword, but is in fact a scroll with a message. Edmund reads it.</i><br />
			<br />
			This is it. Baldrick, get the Bishop of Ramsgate.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Who?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Percy, get Percy. My life is hanging by a thread.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: LORD GRAVENEY'S BEDROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Lord Graveney is dying. A bishop leans over him, holding a will.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			And if I don't leave my lands to the Church, then what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Then, Lord Graveney, you will surely go to hell!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			Alas!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Hell, where the air is pungent with the aroma of roasted behinds!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			<i>(Signs bishop's will)</i> No! No! Argh! I place my lands in the hands of the Church, and so bid the world farewell.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He dies: at that instant, the king crashes through the door and rushes to the bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			What! The archbishop not yet arrived?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			No, my lord, and even if he does arrive ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund bursts in, in a serious panic.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Wait!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Too late!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Get out of my way.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			I'll kill the pair of you. <i>(To the bishop)</i> I'll abolish the Church!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			My lord, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shakes Graveney's corpse, causing his head to flop sideways. Edmund snaps at the bishop.</i><br />
			<br />
			I said ... out!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick opens the door and shoves the bishop through. Now Edmund takes violent action with Graveney, sitting and hitting him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			My lord, my lord. Wake up! Wake up!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Graveney's eyes open.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			Am I in paradise?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Phew! No, not yet.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			Then this must be hell! Alas, spare my posterior!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, no, you're all right. It's England.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			And you are not Satan!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, I'm the Archbishop of Canterbury.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			Oh, your Grace! I have left all my lands to the Church. Am I to be saved?<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			No, you treacherous swine! I'll kill you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund gestures for the king to stop and the turns back to Graveney.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, wait! Let's just deal with this in stages, shall we? You see ... the Church you know, it doesn't really <i>need</i> your land.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			No! What it needs is a damn good thrashing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			But if I do not gain its blessing, I will surely go to hell!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The bishop, who has been listening, bursts</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Yes, hell, where tiny tweezers<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Get out!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick hustles him out again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Someone like you go to hell? Never. Never!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			But I have committed many sins!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Haven't we all, haven't we all!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			I murdered my father.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			<i>(Opens door)</i> Alas!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy and Baldrick slam door shut. Edmund moves even closer to Lord Graveney, puts his head nearly on the pillow and whispers to him ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I know how you feel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Hurry up, Edgar!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			And I have committed adultery.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ha! Who hasn't?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			More than a thousand times?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, it's 1487 after all!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			... with my mother!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Everyone is shocked. There is a moment's silence.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			You see. I will go to hell!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			<i>(Opens door again)</i> Hell, where growths like turnips sprout from your nose and ears.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Kill that bishop!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy and Baldrick leap on him, pushing him to the floor. Baldrick knocks the bishop unconscious with cross.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Uhm, well, let's take hell. You know, it isn't as bad as it's cracked up to be.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			<i>(Incredulous)</i> What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			You see, the thing is, heaven is for people who like the sort of things that go on in heaven. Like, well, singing, talking to God, and watering pot plants. While hell, on the other hand, is for people who prefer, well, you know the other sort of things: adultery, pillage, torture, those ... areas.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, leave your lands to the Crown, and once you're dead you'll have the time of your life.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			<i>(In wonder)</i> Adultery, pillage ... for all eternity?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yup.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			<i>(Coming round)</i> And the smacking of large sticks against your tender portions.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick hits him in the stomach. Percy hits him on the shoulder. He collapses and they kick him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			Very well ... I leave my lands to the Crown.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He signs the king's will.</i><br />
			<br />
			And my soul in the hands of the Lord: may he treat me like the piece of refuse that I am and send me to hell where I belong.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Amen.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Amen: you re a very lucky man. I wish I could be coming with you, but, being archbishop.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			I'm sorry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, no, that's all right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Graveney</b><br />
			Ah!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He dies and the king waves the will triumphantly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			My son!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Father!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The king kneels, Edmund pats him on the head.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Father!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			My son!<br />
			<br />
			<i>It's going very well again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: COUNTRYSIDE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The two same peasants are still walking: two knights splash past them.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Cain</b><br />
			Who's that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Abel</b><br />
			Looks like the sort of pair who'd kill the Archbishop of Canterbury to me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cain</b><br />
			Tssk. Typical.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWELVE: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen is eating alone in the Great Hall. The loud clashing of swords and shouting is heard. The king and Prince Harry enter fighting. Prince Harry is thrown backwards on to the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			You Turkish pig! You Turkish dog!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Father! Father! It's me!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The king lets Prince Harry go. He stands up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			It's all right, my boy, you're improving,	<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Thank you, Father, goodnight, Mother.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			He's gaining on me! He's gaining on me! <br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			How was Edmund?	<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Oh, well, well, well. Chiswick, fresh horse! <br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			And how are his dear little sheep?<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Whose sheep?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Edmund's sheep.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A haunch of horse arrives and the king tucks in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			What sheep?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, the ones in Canterbury. His flock that he was talking about.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			<i> (Utterly exasperated)</i> Oh, my God.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THIRTEEN: COUNTRYSIDE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>As they feast, the two knights ride even faster towards the castle.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOURTEEN: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I can't understand it. Edmund doesn't even like religion.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			But that's impossible. He's the Archbishop of Canterbury!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes, and the Archbishop of Canterbury is also a naughty little boy whose bottom I had to smack for relieving himself in the font.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b>
			Well, that was a long time ago.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			It was last Thursday.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Ha ha ha!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He roars with laughter.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIFTEEN: CASTLE ENTRANCE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The knights crash through the main door, cloaks off, and drinking.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIXTEEN: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Well, the boy's turned out well! <i>(Clinks glasses and breaks the queen'</i>s) A long and healthy life to him! Ah! I thank God that in my lifetime never again shall I have to say, Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?'<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVENTEEN: CASTLE CORRIDOR</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The knights career along a corridor.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHTEEN: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			What is that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Something my ancestor, Henry II, once said, when he was having trouble with Thomas <i>a</i> Becket: he was sitting at a table ... like this with these two drunken knights, and yelled out ... 'Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			God save us. I said:<br />
			<br />
			<i>The knights burst in through the door into the Great Hall, unnoticed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>(Yells)</i> 'Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?'<br />
			<br />
			<i>The knights exchange an excited look with each other.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Meaning who?<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			The Archbishop of Canterbury, of course.<br />
			<br />
			<i>That's that for the knights. They leave the room determinedly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			And then what happened?<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b>
			Well, they went straight off and killed him, of course.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINETEEN: CASTLE GATES</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The two knights crash back out of the main gates of the castle. </i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY: EDMUND'S CATHEDRAL ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund, Percy and Baldrick bound into the room at the abbey.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Right, now, let's get down to business, shall we?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b>
			Business, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, Baldrick has been looking at some of the ways we can actually make a bit of money in this job.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, my lord ... there seems to be four major profit areas. Curses, pardons, relics and selling the sexual favours of nuns.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Selling the sexual favours of nuns ... do some people actually pay?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, foreign businessmen, other nuns, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Let's start with pardons, shall we?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, here's a fair selection. <i>(Lifts papers from floor)</i> Basically you get what you pay for. It runs from this one which is a pardon for talking with your mouth full, signed by an apprentice curate in Tewkesbury.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			How much is that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Two pebbles. All the way up to this one, which is a pardon for anything whatsoever, including 'murder, adultery or dismemberment of a close friend or relative'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And who's that signed by?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Both popes. Curses are pretty much the same really. I bought this one for half an egg.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hands it to Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Aha. 'Dear Enemy, I curse you and hope that something quite unpleasant happens to you, like an onion falling on your head.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That's the lower end of the market, you can get a real helter for four ducats.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hands another to Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			'Dear Enemy, may the Lord hate you and all your kind: may you be turned orange in hue. May your head fall off at an awkward moment.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Does this work?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-ONE: COUNTRYSIDE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Hugely exciting flash of the knights riding, thrilled by the thought of blood.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-TWO: EDMUND'S CATHEDRAL ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Moving on to relics, we've got shrouds from Turin, wine from the wedding at Cana, splinters from the true Cross ... then of course there's all the stuff made by Jesus in his days in the carpentry shop. Pipe racks, coffee tables, cake stands, book ends, crucifixes, nice cheese board, waterproof sandals, fruit bowls; oh I haven't finished this one yet.<br />
			<br />
			<i>It is a brand new, uncompleted thing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			But this is disgraceful, my lord - all of these are obviously fake!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			How will people be able to distinguish between these and real relics?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			They won't: that's the point.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, well, you won't he able to fool everyone. Look: I have here a true relic.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He very dramatically reveals a wooden box.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			A bone from the finger of our Lord. It cost me thirty-one pieces of silver.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Good Lord: is it real?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			It is, my lord. You stand amazed, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I am. I thought they only came in boxes of ten. I could have let you have one for a couple of groats. Fingers are very big at the moment.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Mind you, for a quick sale you can't beat a good nose. Here's the sacred appendage compendium party pack.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He opens up a couple of boxes. Percy is flabbergasted as he inspects and sees they are the same as his.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Here's Jesus's nose, St Peter's nose, a couple of St Francis's and a box of ... <i>(He opens a box which turns out to have a pair of breasts in it)</i> Oh, no, those are Joan of Arc's.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			That bastard verger! I'll show him! I'll show him!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-THREE: THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EDMUND'S CATHEDRAL ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I'll show him!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He moves fast to the door, opens it and is greeted by the sight of the two utterly martial knights, their swords drawn. They are very suave, very calm.</i><br />
			<br />
			Good evening.<br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boeuf and De Boinod</b><br />
			Hail!<br />
			<br />
			<i>For De Boeuf and De Boinod are their names.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			And what can I do for you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boinod</b><br />
			We are here to murder the Archbishop of Canterbury.<br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boeuf</b><br />
			We're his enemies. We fear he may be in danger.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Really? How?<br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boeuf</b><br />
			Well, I mean ... let's see <i>(improvises calmly; they are both very smooth and polite),</i> perhaps good King Richard, angry with the archbishop for some reason, might well send two drunken knights, freshly returned from the Crusades on a mission to wreak vengeance on him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Good point: it's happened before. By the way, I didn't quite catch your names?<br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boinod</b><br />
			We are George de Boeuf and Justin de Boinod, two drunken knights freshly returned from the Crusades and here on a mission for good King Richard. God bless us.<br />
			<br />
			<i>It's all very affable.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Your mission?<br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boinod</b><br />
			Well, as I said, we're here to kill<br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boeuf</b><br />
			A bit of time until the next Crusade.<br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boinod</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, fine, well, I'll go and get him.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The knights raise their swords. At that point, Baldrick pops his head round the door. The knights quickly drop their swords.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ah, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			<i>(Inspecting the knights, terrified)</i> Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Two knights here, to see the archbishop.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, my God!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-FOUR: EDMUND'S CATHEDRAL ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord, I've got something to say that's going to shock you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			If it's about the nuns of Uppingham and the candelabra, don't bother, I've already heard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, my lord. The fact is, there are two men outside who've come to kill you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-FIVE: CATHEDRAL CORRIDOR</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I'm terribly sorry about this. I'll just see what the delay is.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns away and enters Edmund's room.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-SIX: EDMUND'S CATHEDRAL ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund and Baldrick are frantically looking for places to hide: under shrouds, in trunks, fireplaces, on top of beds.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			What's going on?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Those men outside: they're here to kill us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, come on! Honestly, Baldrick! Just because a couple of people obviously have a bit of breeding, you assume they're bound to be mindless killers.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Two swords smash through the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boeuf and De Boinod</b><br />
			Prepare for death, heretics!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund turns in panic to a cross on a little altar.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, my God! There's no way out! Oh, God! Help me!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He grabs the cross and it miraculously pulls forward like a lever. A door opens in the wall.</i><br />
			<br />
			Good Lord!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Quick!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They rush through the door and it closes behind them. The knights finally smash through the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boeuf</b><br />
			Ssssh! They've dozed off.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They creep to the bed and hit it violently, then realize it is a bundle of bedding.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boinod</b><br />
			They've gone down the secret passage to the nunnery!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The knights operate the secret door and charge down the corridor, swords uplifted.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-SEVEN: NUNS' DORMITORY</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The knights burst in, and register with shock that they are in what is obviously a nuns' dormitory. There are three nuns praying.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boinod</b><br />
			Sisters! Three men came in: which way did they go?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(A nun)</i> They went that way ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>The knights set off towards the door. Then suddenly they stop.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boeuf</b><br />
			Wait a second! They'll be watching out for us dressed like this. Quick, in here.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They go into a cubicle. Percy, Edmund and Baldrick, all nuns, meet the knights coming out of the cubicle, also nuns.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Have you sisters pray seen two burly knights pass this way?<br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boinod</b><br />
			No sister, more's the pity.<br />
			<br />
			<b>De Boeuf</b><br />
			Why don't you try that way?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Speaking normally)</i> Thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dc Bomod</b><br />
			<i>(Speaking normally)</i> You're welcome.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all turn away. Then realization dawns. The fight begins. It is an epic encounter: lives hang by a thread, always on the point of being severed by a swishing sword.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-EIGHT: A CORRIDOR IN THE NUNNERY</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The Mother Superior and Sister Sara are strolling towards the dormitory.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Sara</b><br />
			And yet, Mother Superior, does not St Paul say in the Ephesians, 'a woman is like a bat: often heard, but never seen'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mother Superior</b><br />
			No, I don't think so, Sara. Shall we check the dormitory?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sara</b><br />
			Oh, yes, Mother Superior: what a good idea.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-NINE: NUNS' DORMITORY</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A strange sight greets the Mother Superior as she enters the dormitory. Five nuns locked in mortal combat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mother Superior</b><br />
			Girls, girls! If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times. Fighting in the dormitory is completely forbidden. Who's the ringleader here? Yes, yes, you, the plain girl.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She tears the headdress off the nearest nun. It is Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, my God. It's.. . the Archbishop of Canterbury.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Sister Sara removes another headdress.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Sara</b><br />
			And a man.. . aaaaah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah, yes. Look, I think I can explain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THIRTY: NUNS' DORMITORY</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund is standing before the Mother Superior's desk. Sister Sara stands behind Edmund, whipping him gently.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And that, sweet lady, is the whole story.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mother Superior</b><br />
			Let us just go over the facts again. Having been appointed archbishop, you found that all your interest lay in the beauty of your vestments.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Alas, the fine embroidery.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mother Superior</b><br />
			And unable to resist the slide into depravity, you began to dress up in the habit of a nun.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I couldn't resist the texture of the hessian underthings.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mother Superior</b><br />
			Oh, I can understand that, but then you forced the Bishop of Ramsgate and one Brother Baldrick to do so also.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			May I be cursed for it!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mother Superior</b><br />
			And finally you got two knights drunk and invited them to come and wrestle with you inside the nunnery in an orgy of heathen perversity.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			That's right, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mother Superior</b><br />
			This shameful tale bears the unmistakable ring of truth. And I must therefore tell you that this morning I have written urgently to all three popes recommending your immediate excommunication. Never more may you be Archbishop of Canterbury.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, dear.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mother Superior</b><br />
			That's enough, Sister Sara. I think he's learnt his lesson.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Sister Sara stops beating him.</i><br />
			<br />
			Go, sinner, and meet thy doom.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The doors of the room mysteriously open. There is a long stretch of darkness outside, into which Edmund walks, head held high, archbishop no more, thank God.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THIRTY-ONE: NUNS' DORMITORY</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Later that night, a final glimpse of religious life.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mother Superior</b><br />
			Alas, the corruption of the world.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sara</b><br />
			Yes, alas, Mother Superior.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mother Superior</b><br />
			I am tired and weary. You may leave me now.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sara</b><br />
			Very well.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mother Superior</b><br />
			Alas.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sara</b><br />
			So presumably you won't be needing the unicorn tonight?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mother Superior</b><br />
			No, Sara. No. Not tonight.
