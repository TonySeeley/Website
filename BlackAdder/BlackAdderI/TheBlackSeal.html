			<H1>The Black Seal</H1>
			<i>Many are the tales told of the Black Adder, and of his faithful henchmen, Lord Percy Percy and
			Baldrick, son of Robin the Dung Gatherer. But none is told so oft, with so much hitting of heads
			in wonder and repeating of exciting parts as this, the final chapter in the Book of ... the Black
			Adder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ONE: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>England 1498. St Juniper's Day, the day on which the king would lavish new honours upon his
			kinfolk.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is an important state occasion. The king is flanked by the queen and his guards. Edmund
			stands, handsome and proud.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			St Juniper once said: 'By his loins shall ye know him, and by the length of his rod shall he be
			measured.' The length of my rod is a mystery to all but the queen and a thousand Turkish whores;
			but the fruits of my loins are here for all to see. I have two sons: Harry and ... another one.
			Step forward Harry. Prince of Wales.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry steps forward, arms folded. He bows low, and then spreads his arms out and lies
			completely prostrate on the floor in front of the king.</i><br />
			<br />
			I hereby name thee Captain of the Guard; Grand Warden of the Northern and Eastern Marches; Chief
			Lunatic of the Duchy of Gloucester; Viceroy of Wales; Sheriff of Nottingham ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>While the list is being read, Edmund is tapping his feet, looking at the sky, inspecting his
			fingernails. He is bored.</i> ... Marquess of the Midlands; Lord Polemaker in Ordinary; and Harbinger
			of the Doomed Rat.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He hands Prince Harry the scroll. Prince Harry bows and walks back.</i><br />
			<br />
			Step forward, the other one.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund folds his arms and goes forward to the king, bowing extravagantly, lying prostrate on the
			floor as Prince Harry did.</i><br />
			<br />
			Until now, thy titles have been but few: Duke of Edinburgh and Warden of the Royal Privies.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Even so, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			We thank thee, Egbert, for your work in Edinburgh. Know now we do relieve thee of thy heavy task, and
			give the dukedom to our loyal cousin, Hastings.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The king folds the scroll and passes it to Hastings - it seems it is a birthday present.</i><br />
			<br />
			Many happy returns, Tom.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Thus have I discharged the duties of Juniper.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He steps forward, placing his feet on either side of Edmund's head.</i><br />
			<br />
			Chiswick: fresh horses! We ride at once for Stoke, where it is my sworn intent to approach the city
			walls, bare my broad buttocks and cry, 'Behold, I honour thee most highly!' Come, all who are brave!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The king walks over Edmund and the room swiftly empties. Percy and Baldrick run to Edmund and crouch
			by his head.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, it could have been worse, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			There was a moment there I thought you were going to lose the Privies.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund leaps to his feet.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b>
			No!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick and Percy recede, frightened. It is a hugely dramatic and scary and defining moment.</i><br />
			<br />
			It will <i>not</i> do.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			No, my lord, you're right. It won't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I must clear away the chaff from my life and let shine forth the true wheat of greatness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Do it at once, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He thinks Baldrick is in for the sack.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Very well: Percy. You are dismissed from my service.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Me? Why, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Why? Because, Percy, far from being a fit consort for a Prince of the Realm, you would bore the leggings
			off a village idiot. You ride a horse rather less well than another horse would. Your brain would make
			a grain of sand look large and ungainly and the part of you that can't be mentioned, I am reliably
			informed by women around the Court, wouldn't he worth mentioning even if it could be. If you put on a
			floppy hat and a funny cod-piece, you might just get by as a fool, but since you wouldn't know a joke
			if it got up and gave you a haircut, I doubt it. That's why you're dismissed.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund heads out, followed by Baldrick. Percy stands stock still, shocked to his very soul.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, I see.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And as for you, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			You're out, too.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he walks out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Fair enough.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE CASTLE COURTYARD</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>So Edmund spurned his friends and began his quest for glory.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund and Baldrick walk out into the courtyard.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I suppose you'll go back to shovelling dung in the gutter where I found you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I shouldn't think so.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No such luck. I had to wait years for that job: that's quite a good position. I'll probably be milking
			pigs or mucking out the lepers or something.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes. It'll be years before I get back to shovelling dung again.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund walks away and Baldrick wipes away a tear.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: THE CASTLE GATES</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A hundred yards later.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund rides his horse out of the gates and almost knocks over an old man. The horse rears.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Get out of my way!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Old Man</b><br />
			Going on a journey, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, I thought I'd stand here all day and talk to you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Old Man</b><br />
			You'll be needing someone to tend to your horse, then.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, and if I did, I wouldn't take you. I mean, look at you. What is your profession?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Old man takes out a rag and begins a foolish dance.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, God. A retired Morris dancer. That's all I need. Oh well, never mind. If you can keep up, you can
			come.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund rides off as fast as he can. Then, perhaps rather unexpectedly, the old man on his donkey
			rides up easily and passes Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Thus did Edmund set forth into England with his rather irritating new old servant. His purpose to
			scour the land and search out the six other Most Evil Men in the kingdom. Only then would the time
			have come for ..</i>. <i>the Black Adder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: A WOOD</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Sir Wilfred Death</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund and the old man are behind a tree.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Here he comes now.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund steps out as Sir Wilfred Death rides proudly towards them. Suddenly a horse rears out in
			front of him, and two other men, on horseback, appear on either side.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, my God.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Robber</b><br />
			So, Sir Wilfred Death. Your tyranny is at an end! Prepare to be strung by your codlings from the
			boughs of that tree.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			Never!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Loud screams and scuffling ensue. Within seconds the two robbers are swinging by their testicles
			from a tree. Sir Wilfred strides away and Edmund steps out in front of him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Sir Wilfred Death!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			Edmund!<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a butch double-handed handshake between them.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I'm looking for some men - to take over the kingdom.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			How many have you got so far?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund raises one finger. Wilfred meaningfully gives him a two-fingered salute. He's in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: A FIELD</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Three-Fingered Pete</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>A very villainous man indeed is standing in the field. It is Three-Fingered Pete. Beside him stands
			a sturdy peasant. Near them is a horse.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Pete</b><br />
			So we are agreed: he who wins takes the horse?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The peasant nods wisely and confidently. He's sure he's a crack shot and this is an archery contest!
			Pete points at the target across the common.</i><br />
			<br />
			There is our mark: you shoot first.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The peasant raises his bow deliberately and shoots. It hits the bull's eye.</i><br />
			<br />
			Yes. Good. Very good. So good in fact ... <i>(He takes out his arrow and lines it up)</i> I'm going to
			have to ... <i>(He aims at the target and then at the last moment turns and shoots the peasant) ...</i>
			cheat.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Sir Wilfred is on the horizon.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			Three-Fingered Pete!!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Pete looks up and then at his hand. Edmund raises three fingers. It's going well.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: A COPSE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Guy de Glastonbury</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>A coach is approaching. A bandit appears on horseback. It is Guy. The coach slows down. The lord
			inside looks out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Guy</b><br />
			Good evening, and surrender: your money or your life.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord</b><br />
			Here, take it! It is all the money I have.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He tosses him a bag of gold.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Guy</b><br />
			Thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord</b><br />
			Now, let me pass.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guy</b><br />
			Oh, damn: I'm always doing this. Did I say, your money or your life?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord</b><br />
			You did.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guy</b><br />
			Sorry, slip of the tongue. Your money <i>and</i> your life.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shoots a cross bow and politely kills the poor fellow.</i><br />
			<br />
			Sorry.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He rides on and turns to the driver of the coach.</i><br />
			<br />
			Thanks, Ned. See you Thursday?<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a smatter of applause and Wilfred, Edmund and Pete step out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			Guy!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guy</b><br />
			Wilfred!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			Now what we need is a real bastard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pete</b><br />
			Sean the Irish Bastard?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Wilfred nods and smiles.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: A VILLAGE SQUARE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Sean the Irish Bastard</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is night. A man armed to the teeth, knives everywhere, is slinking along a wall. Another man,
			the over-fat figure of the local squire, is walking along the pavement, his feet clacking. He passes
			two beggars.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>First Beggar</b><br />
			Money for the blind!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The squire raises his nose in the air and walks on. Sean is waiting behind a corner. The squire's
			footsteps pass. Sean leaps out and quickly darts left to steal the money from the beggars, letting
			the squire pass on. The First Beggar feels in his hat. Nothing there.</i><br />
			<br />
			Here, business is very quiet this morning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Second Beggar</b><br />
			Aye, everyone's gone to lunch, I think.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Sean moves off and runs into Wilfred.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			Sean!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: A HILLSIDE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Next morning. All are riding along. Edmund gives the sign: five fingers. They all do five,
			including the confident Pete, who does three.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: THE EDGE OF A WOOD</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A friar, a father and his virginal daughter are present. It is an obvious parting place, and the
			father and girl have just hugged goodbye. The father is very concerned.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Father</b><br />
			Friar, I fear greatly for her chastity.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Friar</b><br />
			Alas, such is the way of the world. The sweetest rose too often is ... plucked too soon ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Father</b><br />
			I wonder whether you might take her while I am gone.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The holy friar registers a tiny surprise. Then inspects her.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Friar</b><br />
			Yes. The answer is yes. I shall.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: THE EDGE OF THE WOOD</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Friar Bellows</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund and the others peer through a bush, to reveal a clearing within which is the friar himself.
			He is heartily rogering the daughter, a contented smile on his features as he whistles and takes in
			the flora and fauna.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			Friar Bellows ... doing the Lord's work?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Friar</b><br />
			Er ... just administering extreme unction.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The others smile at each other. The task is almost done.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: OPEN COUNTRY</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Jack Large</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>The Black Seal, for so must they now be known, are riding along.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And who shall be the seventh, Wilfred?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			Why, need I say? ... Jack.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The horsemen all stop in horror simultaneously.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Guy</b><br />
			What, Mad Bully Boy Jack, the GraveRobbing Assassin of Aldwych?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pete</b><br />
			Then Crazed Animal Jack, the Cattle Rustling Cannibal from Sutton Coldfield?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sean</b><br />
			Then your man is Sane Jack O'Hooligan, the Man-Hating Goat-Murderer of Dingle Bay?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Friar</b><br />
			Surely not Canon Jack Smollett, Senior Archdeacon of the Diocese of St Wotan, the Entrail-Eating
			Heretic of Bath and Wells?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			No. I'm talking about Unspeakably Violent Jack, the Bull-Buggering Priest Killer of no fixed abode.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They are all profoundly shocked.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Are you sure he's the kind of chap we're looking for?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			Yes. And here he comes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They are on the brow of a hill. Wilfred points at a giant of a man in the distance.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>This huge man is walking boldly through the countryside. But suddenly a tiny man appears and keeps
			getting under his feet. The giant turns and with huge strength grips the little man, first the left
			hand on his shoulder, then the right, and lifts him up to his own face level.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Giant</b><br />
			What do you think you're doing?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The small man viciously butts the giant, who falls unconscious, and heads on. For he is Jack Large.
			And suddenly, there are the Black Seal.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Jack</b><br />
			Boys!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			Are you with us?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Jack</b><br />
			Aye!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund lifts both hands and makes a mighty seven. These deeply bad men will change the world.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWELVE: A FILTHY TAVERN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund's old servant sits outside with his donkey and the horses. The others are still laughing as
			they enter the tavern.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>They sit around a table. Edmund is trying to be as at ease with these people as he can be: he is
			endlessly aspiring to their level of evil and camaraderie. The Seal are all laughing and toasting each
			other.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And, Jack, tell me, what is your second name?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Jack</b><br />
			Large, Jack Large.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ha, then in our band, you shall be known as Large Jack.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He laughs. There is silence from the others, who seem less amused, particularly Jack.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Jack</b><br />
			Why?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Because you are so little.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Jack</b><br />
			I see. Why not Little Jack, then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahm, because Large Jack is more amusing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Jack</b><br />
			Is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Very well, then, Little Jack.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Jack points his sword at him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Jack</b><br />
			You wish to mock my size?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, no, no, of course not. Ahm, innkeeper, more beer.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Six large beers ... and another large beer. Let us then go on to the plan!<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Yes, the plan, the plan!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Friar</b><br />
			But first - a motto for our enterprise.<br />
			<br />
			'Blessed are the meek ...'<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is general consternation.	</i><br />
			<br />
			 ...'for they shall be slaughtered!'<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			<i>(Raising weapons)</i> Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all stand and rush to the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			But wait. The plan, the plan; you have forgot the plan!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pete</b><br />
			I thought that was the plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sean</b><br />
			Let's get those meek bastards now!<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund	</b><br />
			No, quiet! Quiet!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They fall quiet. There is a pause.</i>	<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			Yes, who wants quiet? I want chaos!	<br />
			<br />
			<i>His sword swipes at the table and knocks everything off it.	</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Jack</b><br />
			And slaughter!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pete</b><br />
			And flowers!<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pete</b><br />
			Mercilessly crushed under foot.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Friar</b><br />
			Silence!<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Silence!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guy</b><br />
			Peace, for the word of the Lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all sit.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Friar</b><br />
			For Christ's sake, let's hear the plan.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund gathers himself.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Very well. The plan is simple.<br />
			<br />
			<i>General annoyance from the Seal.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			I thought it was cunning!<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Down with the plan!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			It's cunning in its simplicity. Tonight, I ride for home ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Seal turn on Edmund. Wilfred grabs him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			I say strike now while the iron is hot!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			But the iron isn't hot!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			Isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, it's just warming up. When it is hot, then we will strike.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sean</b><br />
			What, are we going to have to wait till summer?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No: when the iron is hot.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pete</b><br />
			What iron?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund quivers with frustration, but finally gathers himself and continues.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			When my brother returns, I shall send for you all.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Friar</b><br />
			How?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			By a message, a sign.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guy</b><br />
			What sort of sign?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, something black probably.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Jack</b><br />
			Black pudding?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pete</b><br />
			A messenger with Black Plague, perhaps?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, that's better.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Friar</b><br />
			He means to kill us!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			A messenger with black hair.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			A black-headed messenger.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, and when he comes to you, drop what you are doing and speed with all haste to Jaspar's tavern.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sean</b><br />
			Ah, I know it well. How is Jolly Jaspar these days?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pete</b><br />
			Dead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Jack</b><br />
			How?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Friar</b><br />
			I killed him.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Wilfred pats him on the back.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Guy</b><br />
			Oh, well done.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			From there, I shall take you to the castle, where we shall capture the king and the queen and the prince.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Stands)</i> And say: 'The Kingdom of Albion is ours!'<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			'You are doomed to lives of exile! Get out!'<br />
			<br />
			<i>Pause. There is dead silence where there should have been applause.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Pete</b><br />
			Exile?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, exile! For life!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guy</b><br />
			But why don't we just kill them?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, yes, I suppose we could kill them.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Yes, <i>kill, kill, kill!</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>They charge for the door again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No! Wait! Remember! Wait until I send the sign.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sean</b><br />
			If I get a messenger with blackheads all over his face, I'll kill the ugly bastard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			How do we know it's not a trap?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Utter suspicion is suddenly directed	against Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Because, look. The Black Adder gives you his word.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			But we want your word, not this Black Adder fellow's.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I am the Black Adder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pete</b><br />
			Oh, I see.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And when all is done, the Black Seal shall rule England. We few, we happy few, we band of ruthless
			bastards!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He stands triumphantly on the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>All for one!</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			<i>And each man for himself!</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a final dramatic show of weapons and then they all leave.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THIRTEEN: A FOREST GLADE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Night time. The old man and Edmund are throwing sticks into the fire they have lit. It is a rare
			moment of confident peace and beauty.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Old Man</b><br />
			You're in a merry mood, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh yes. No one can stop me now!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Old Man</b><br />
			No one?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, no one. Except perhaps ... no, not even him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Old Man</b>
			And whom might that be, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, there was a man, Philip of Burgundy, known to his enemies as the Hawk. We were deadly childhood
			rivals. Of course, in those days he was known as the Thrush. But no one's heard of him for years.
			Come on, let's go. We've got work to do.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Old Man</b><br />
			Not so fast, Edinburgh.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Suddenly the old man's voice changes into a deep and noble bass.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Whipping round) What?</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Old Man</b><br />
			This Hawk, did he look something like ... this?<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a blinding white light and suddenly the old man is transformed from someone rather
			scruffy into a grand gentleman, with elegant clothes and a noble bearing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Erm ... Not really, no.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The old man tears off his bushy eyebrows, revealing almost identical ones underneath. Edmund
			jumps.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, my God, Philip of Burgundy!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			Known to my enemies as ... <i>(with panache he puts on a Robin Hood-style cap)</i> the Hawk!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			But your horse ... it was a huge brown ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>A huge brown horse appears at his side.</i><br />
			<br />
			Yes, that's the one. Well ... <i>(Smiles)</i> It's very good to see you, er, Phil.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns round to go, but the Hawk steps on the end of his pointy shoes, trapping him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b>
			This time, not fast enough!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, God. What do you want with me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			I'll tell you later.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He knocks Edmund unconscious, and laughs like evil villains should.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOURTEEN: A DARK AND DISMAL DUNGEON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The Hawk pushes Edmund downstairs into the dungeon and follows him in. He holds a sword to
			Edmund's back.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			Ha, ha, ha! I return at last, after fifteen years.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(On the floor)</i> And what have you been up to?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			Waiting, plotting, nurturing my hatred and planning my revenge.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			So, you've kept yourself busy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			Yes. Fifteen years in France teaches a man to hate. Fifteen years of wearing perfume, fifteen years
			of eating frogs, fifteen years of saying <i>'Pardon?'</i> ... All because of <i>you.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			But surely the scenery ...?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			I never went outside: I couldn't stand the smell.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Whimpering)</i> But what has all this got to do with me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			Because, Edmund, it's going to take you fifteen years to die.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Fifteen years?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			How?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			I think it would be more amusing if you found out for yourself. Let me just say it has something
			to do with snails.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He opens a trapdoor in a rock with his sword. The rock swings down to reveal several small snails
			clinging to it. The Hawk makes to leave.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, my God. Where are you going?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			Why, to the castle, to kill the royal family and claim the throne that isn't mine by right.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He</i> exits. <i>Edmund stares at the snails in terror. Outside, the Hawk, astride his horse
			in matching colour, rides off to the castle.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIFTEEN: THE DUNGEON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Back inside, Edmund is kneeling and praying to the god who has featured very little in his life
			so far.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Dear Lord, who made the birds and the bees ... and the snails, presumably, ahm, please help me, a
			little animal too, in my despair. I have been a sinner, but now I intend to follow the path of the
			saints: particularly the very religious ones. In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			Amen.<br />
			<br />
			<i>His voice comes out of the darkness. Edmund had no idea anyone else was there. He leaps in terror.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mad Gerald leaps out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			Amen, I said. Did I get it wrong? Ha, ha. Haven't heard that word for twenty years, you see.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Who are you? I ... didn't realize I had company.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			<i>(With relish)</i> Ha, ha, ha. 'Company' - haven't heard that word for twenty years either. Or
			'realize' - I'd completely forgotten! 'Realize'!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh no, you're not mad, are you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			Arr, yes, I'm very mad, thank you. 'Mad'! That's a word I know - I say it to myself every morning:
			'Morning, Mad Gerald, how are you?' I say, 'I'm completely mad, today thank you.' 'So, no change
			there,' I reply. 'No, you'd be mad to expect any.' 'I am mad, aren't I?' 'Yes, you are, you're mad,
			Gerald.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Quiet! Shhh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			Shhh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Look, I know this may seem a stupid question ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			Question.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			 ... but you don't know if there's a way out of here, do you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			A way out?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He laughs manically, for a long time.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIXTEEN: THE DUNGEON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Twelve months later. Edmund is sitting in the cell looking desolate. Mad Gerald is still laughing
			manically and dancing around.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			Ha, ha, ha. A way out, you say?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			I haven't heard those words 'a way out' for o..<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Twenty years?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			Yes, twenty years! Not like Mr Rat. I'm always saying Mr Rat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			Well, I tend to say, 'Good morning, Mr Rat. How are you today?' And then Mr
			Rat says <i>(rubbing his nose),</i> 'Myim, myim.' Ha, ha, ha!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVENTEEN: THE DUNGEON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Still more months have passed. Edmund is sitting with Mad Gerald on the straw.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			No, no, you mustn't be rude about Mr Rat, you know. He's my best friend.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			Well, there's him and Mr Key.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			Mr Key. I made him out of my own teeth.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes out a pretty white key and holds it in front of his mouth. Edmund isn't very interested.</i><br />
			<br />
			Good morning, Mr Key.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund suddenly looks at the key again. It looks strangely convincing. He grabs it, unlocks the
			door and sprints up the stairs outside the dungeon. From inside Mad Gerald shouts to him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Gerald</b><br />
			Hey! Close the bloody door!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHTEEN: A ROAD</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund reaches a road and meets a man on a cart.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Stop! Where are you going?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Man on cart</b><br />
			I'll tell you where - wherever I can sell these six black homing pigeons I've got in the back, that's
			where.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Black homing pigeons?<br />
			<br />
			<i>This is too good to be true. Black pigeons</i> ... <i>the Black Seal ... the summoning.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Man on cart</b><br />
			Well, mostly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			How much are they?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Man on cart</b><br />
			Six shillings.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund feels desperately in his pockets.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Damn.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Man on cart</b><br />
			<i>(Merrily)</i> Although I suppose if you beat me and gagged me and tied me to that tree over there,
			you could have them for less.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, right.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Two minutes later, the man on the cart is tied to a tree, gagged, and Edmund is riding away. He
			arrives back at the castle. From the battlements he releases the pigeons, and in the courtyard
			releases a small black chicken.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Across England the five pigeons make very fast landings on five members of the Black Seal. The
			sixth bird is seen in the sky, and then it is shot.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>A few minutes later, Jack Large roasts the chicken on a spit. Suddenly he spits out a black ring
			and the relevance of it hits him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINETEEN: A STOCKROOM IN THE CASTLE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The room is empty. The Hawk enters in his messenger disguise. He rips it off and is revealed in
			his full glory. He takes out his sword and holds it high above his head.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			Ha! At the striking of ten bells, I shall claim the throne.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The bell strikes three times. But then, at the next six strikes, each of the Black Seal bursts out
			of suitable hiding places in the room. On the tenth strike, the Hawk addresses them.</i><br />
			<br />
			Gentlemen, to what do I owe this pleasure?<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is an irritated banging on the inside of the largest wardrobe. Edmund can't get out. Guy
			slashes off the lock and Edmund emerges heroically.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			To me, Burgundy!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Hawk is genuinely shocked.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			Edmund! I had not expected to see you again.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, dead men don't tend to make social calls, do they?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Seal all laugh.</i><br />
			<br />
			Prepare to die!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Five weapons arrive at the Hawk's throat. Jack Large's knife is at his testicles.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			No, wait. Let me just say one last thing ... if these men are indeed, as they seem to be, the six
			most evil men in the land ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, they are! Your last sentence please.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			Then they've made a pretty damn peculiar choice for their leader, haven't they? My Lord Warden of
			the Privies.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What? Do you think they should have chosen you, Thrush?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Seal laugh.</i><br />
			<br />
			A man twisted by unbridled ambition!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Rebellious murmuring is heard from the Seal.</i><br />
			<br />
			A man tortured by insatiable greed! (<i>The Seal become louder.</i>)
			The evillest man in the world! Do you think they should have chosen you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Black Seal</b><br />
			Yes!<br />
			<br />
			<i>And with a swooshing sound the six weapons are suddenly at Edmund's throat and codlings.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			But he's a mindless killer!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Black Seal</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			He'll destroy the kingdom!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Black Seal</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			He murdered his whole family!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Pete</b><br />
			Who didn't? I certainly killed mine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wilfred</b><br />
			And I killed mine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Friar</b><br />
			And I killed yours.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sean</b><br />
			Did you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Friar</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sean</b><br />
			Good on you, Father.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			Are you with me, then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Black Seal</b><br />
			Yes!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			<i>(To Edmund)</i> Prepare to die.<br />
			<br />
			<i>It is about to happen, when ... </i><br />
			<br />
			Wait! I have a more amusing method.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Amusing for whom, I wonder?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Hawk pulls back a curtain to reveal the most terrible and complex instrument of terror. The
			Seal take a step backwards in shock and admiration. They cheer and clap. Minutes later Edmund is
			imprisoned in the device.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			In precisely one minute ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns a one-minute hourglass.</i><br />
			<br />
			 ... the spike will go up your nethers, the shears will cut off your ears.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Both of them?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			Yes. The axes will chop off your hands. I don't think we need to go into the attributes of the
			coddling grinder. And these two little feathers here will tickle you under what's left of your
			arms, which is the amusing part. Gentlemen, let us go and slaughter everyone else in the royal
			family.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Black Seal</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			God Save the King.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Black Seal</b><br />
			Because nobody else will!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They leap from the room. Edmund gives a terrified look at the hourglass: the sand is slipping
			by.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY: A CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE STOCKROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The Black Seal emerge dramatically into the corridor.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Hawk</b><br />
			On!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He heads round a corner, then stops them.</i> Stop!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Two maidservants emerge from around the corner, each carrying a tray of drinks. The Hawk, with
			his sword drawn, laughs.</i><br />
			<br />
			Let us first relieve these two old warhorses of their delightful burden, and drink a toast to our
			enterprise.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all grab a drink.</i><br />
			<br />
			May God thrive!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Black Seal</b><br />
			Over our dead bodies.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They gulp down the wine and charge down the corridor. Suddenly, they die by vicious poisoning.
			Only Sean survives, who gets up calmly and totters over towards the women.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Sean</b><br />
			Mmm, it's got a bit of a sting in its tail.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes another goblet, drinks it, and dies as well. The women tear off their headdresses:
			they are Percy and Baldrick. They hug and shake hands enthusiastically, but are frozen by Edmund's
			dreadful cries as each part of the torture mechanism takes its effect. A little giggle caused by
			the feathers is finally heard.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick and Percy look uncomfortable. Maybe they left it a teensy bit late.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-ONE: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A psalm is playing on a full organ. Edmund is in bed looking in a very rough state: bloody,
			bandaged ears and hands, and deathly pale.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, Edmund, Edmund!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Edmund!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund's eyes jerk open.</i><br />
			<br />
			He lives!<br />
			<br />
			<i>All around stand the lords of the court. A huge cheer goes up. Edmund whispers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Father, you called me Edmund!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Sorry, Edgar. How are you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Not so well. Harry. what do you think my chances are?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Oh good, good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			He will live?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Oh no, sorry, I thought you meant chances of going to heaven.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh damn.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			But have no fear. My son, your body may have been mutilated beyond recognition, but your spirit
			will live for ever. My lords!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He raises his glass.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-TWO: A CORRIDOR IN THE CASTLE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy and Baldrick have been sitting quite happily in the castle, waiting for news of Edmund,
			but Percy has just shattered the calm. Baldrick looks aghast.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			<i>What</i> did you say?<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-THREE: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The king is in mid-toast.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			 ... I give you - Edgar!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Everyone takes their glasses and raises them to Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-FOUR: A CORRIDOR IN THE CASTLE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy and Baldrick are sprinting down the corridor.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I told you to poison the Black Seal's goblets, not to poison the whole vat!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-FIVE: BACK IN THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Edgar!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund pulls the king down to whisper in his ear the name by which he would wish always to
			be remembered.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			The Black Dagger!<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			The Black Dagger!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all drink.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			May his name last as long as our dynasty.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry, the queen and then the king and court all drop down dead.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Good Lord! I wonder if it was the wine?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes a polite sip.</i><br />
			<br />
			No, seems perfectly all right to me. Now I shall be King of E.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he dies. For ever.</i>
