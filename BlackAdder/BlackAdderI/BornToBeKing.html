			<H1>Born To Be King</H1>
			<b>SCENE ONE: THE COURTYARD OUTSIDE A MIGHTY CASTLE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>In 1486, the second year of Richard IV's historic reign and also the year in which the egg replaced the worm as
			the lowest form of currency, King Richard departed England on a Crusade against the Turks.<br />
			<br />
			People are milling around, waiting for the king to appear. He rides out of the castle into the courtyard.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			As the Good Lord said: 'Love thy neighbour as thyself unless he's Turkish: in which case, kill the bastard!'<br />
			<br />
			<i>He left behind him his beloved son Prince Harry to rule as regent in his stead.<br />
			<br />
			Prince Harry isn't quite sure of his father's biblical accuracy.</i><br />
			<br />
			Farewell, dear Harry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Farewell, father.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And his slimy son Edmund to do the tasks most befitting him.<br />
			<br />
			Edmund is smiling. The king looks briefly at him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Edward.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The King rides off, accompanied by a splendidly dressed entourage. Harry waves, anxiously; Edmund tries to look
			concerned. Baldrick sidles up to him and whispers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord, with the king gone ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Of course! At last, a chance for some real power!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: OUTSIDE THE CASTLE WALLS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is twelve months later. Snow is thick on the ground. Edmund is on horseback, imperiously shouting instructions,
			and waving his sword.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Come on, you scum! Move it: I want you hack to the castle by sundown, or you'll all be slaughtered. Onward!<br />
			<br />
			<i>However, all is not as grand as it seems. Edmund is actually herding a small flock of sheep.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry is reading a letter by the fire and beaming.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Splendid. Splendid!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He looks up at the sound of a door opening. Edmund is trying to close the door on the sheep, who have evidently
			followed him home. Loud baaing noises from outside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Now look! You're not supposed to be here! That's far enough. Now get out!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He finally slams the door on the determined sheep.</i><br />
			<br />
			My God, just wait till I get my hands on that bastard brother Harry.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns and sees Prince Harry, and tries to hide behind the wall.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Ah, Edmund. There you are. Splendid news. <i>(He blocks the fire)</i> Father's coming home. He'll lie here by St
			Leonard's Day. So we can celebrate both events together. I'll handle the visiting royalty, the guards of honour, and
			the papal legate. And you can sort out the frolics.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			The frolics?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes, the Morris dancers, the eunuchs, and the bearded women. You know, the traditional St Leonard's Day
			entertainment. Damnation, I won't have enough time to attend to the drains. Edmund, you'll have to look into those
			as well.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Urn. Yes. Fine, fine. Ahm, I'd be honoured.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Good. You won't let me down, will you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, no. I won't. I'm really looking forward to it already. Thank you so very much.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Splendid.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, no! Twelve months of chasing sheep and straightening the royal portraits, and now this. The bastard! The
			bastard!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick suddenly appears. A strange, insinuating figure.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			If only he <i>were,</i> my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			If only he were a bastard, my lord: then you would be regent now!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah, yes! And then one day<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy also appears as if from nowhere.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			You would be king, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah, yes, I would lie king. And then what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick and Percy</b><br />
			You'd rule the world, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Precisely! It's just not fair, you know: every other woman in the Court has bastard sons, but not my mother. Oh,
			no! She's so damn pure she doesn't dare look down in case she notices her own breasts.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen is by afire with a rather fulsome lady-in-waiting, yarning wool.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady-in-waiting</b><br />
			You must be <i>so</i> looking forward to the king's return, your Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady-in-waiting</b><br />
			No, my lady? But think, he will come to your chamber and make mad, passionate love to you!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes, and I wish he wouldn't do that. It's very difficult to sleep with that sort of thing going on, you know. Being
			used all night long. Like the outside of a sausage roll.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady-in-waiting</b><br />
			Still, my lady: we've got the St Leonard's Day celebrations to look forward to. The
			jesters, the jugglers ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			The great brown ox, steaming and smouldering all night long.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady-in-waiting</b><br />
			Oh yes: the feast!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Sorry. No, I was thinking of something else.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady-in-waiting</b><br />
			I particularly hope they've got the Morris dancers: I <i>love</i> them.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes: I like the eunuchs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady-in-waiting</b><br />
			Oh, yes! The <i>eunuchs!</i> I wish I owned one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I wish I'd married one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is on the bed. Percy is sitting at the table reading a scroll. A well-built woman is just leaving Edmund's
			room.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, that's all right! Fine, fine. Could have happened to anyone.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shuts the door. Percy and Baldrick are looking wary.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, my God. We've only got one act, and she's shaved her beard off.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy inspects the scroll closely.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			There are the eunuchs, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, yes. So? The eunuchs and the Amazing Beardless Woman. There must be someone else, there must be!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, there's the Jumping Jews of Jerusalem.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What do they do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			They jump, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			They come in and they ... they jump a lot, my lord. It's a humorous act.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Argh! There must be something else, surely? The Death of the Pharaoh! <i>(He grabs the scroll and reads from it)</i>
			Sir Dominic Prick and his Magnificent Strolling Wooferoonies perform the tragic ancient Egyptian masterpiece, the
			Death of the Pharaoh. Well, that sounds funny.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, no, no, no, I found it very moving, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, it'd better be funny or Prick'll get his come-uppance, I can tell you. Book him.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is also reading a scroll. He gets off the bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What about Jerry Merryweather and his Four Chickens, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What do they do? Lay eggs?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			All right, book them.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a knock on the door Percy opens it, takes a message and slams the door in the messenger's face. He
			hands the message to Edmund, who reads it and looks furious.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			What is it, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			The eunuchs have cancelled.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, dear.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ha! I should have known: never trust a eunuch.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			What are we going to do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, I know what I'm going to do. Baldrick, give me an execution order.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick takes an order from his belt and hands it to Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			I'm going to teach them a lesson they'll never forget. I'm going to remove whatever extraneous parts of their bodies
			still remain.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund opens the door, where the messenger is still standing, and hands the order to him.</i><br />
			<br />
			Take that to the Lord Chancellor.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns back to Baldrick and Percy. This is desperate.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			We could have the Morris dancers, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Not that desperate. Morris dancing is the most fatuous tenth-rate entertainment ever devised by man: forty effeminate
			blacksmiths waving bits of cloth they've just wiped their noses on. How it's still going on in this day and age, I'll never
			know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Sorry, so do you want them or not?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund hits Percy with the scroll. Prince Harry enters without knocking.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Ah, Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They do not want Harry to know that they're panicking, so ... they all start bouncing and waving scrolls like the
			best Morris dancers. Edmund hits Baldrick. Percy hits Edmund. And Edmund brings it gently to a close.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And rest.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Oh! splendid. <i>(He claps)</i> And how are the entertainments coming along?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Erm ... well, very, very well indeed. I think it's going to have a slightly <i>spartan</i> look.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			What, Greek?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, that's right. Yes, a Greek look.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			So everyone's turning up?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Absolutely everyone ... So many people, in fact, that I've had to let the eunuchs go.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Oh, no, no, no, no!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			No, that won't do at all! Not on St Leonard's Day: because, correct me if I'm wrong, Lord Percy, St Leonard himself
			was a eunuch.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, that's right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes: that's why I thought it might be more tactful ... if<br />
			<br />
			<i>He looks up to heaven respectfully.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			No, no, no. To leave out the eunuchs on St Leonard's Day would be like, well, leaving out the Morris dancers, or
			the bearded woman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			And besides, as you know, we are expecting Father's Supreme Commander, Lord Dougal McAngus, at the feast and,
			as you know, eunuchs are his particular favourite. He's Scottish, you see.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, I see.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Well, I'm relying on you, Edmund. Carry on.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry leaves. Edmund is very angry.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, I see, so some carrot-faced, thistle-arsed Scottish orang-utan would like some eunuchs, would -he?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Apparently he's a great warrior, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, that's what they all say. These Scots are all the same. Barbarians: half of them can't even speak English.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What do they speak?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I don't know: it's all Greek to me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			They speak Greek?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No - I mean it sounds like Greek.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, if it sounds like Greek, it probably is Greek.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			It's not Greek!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			But it sounds <i>like</i> Greek. What's not Greek, but sounds like Greek? That's a good one, my lord!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Look, it's not meant to be a brain teaser, Percy. <i>(Shouting)</i> I'm simply telling you that I cannot understand
			a blind word they're saying.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, no wonder, my lord! You've never learned Greek, of course.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Percy, have you ever wondered what your insides look like?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Sometimes, my lord, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund draws his dagger.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, then, I'd be perfectly willing to satisfy your curiosity. Oh, God, this Scotsman's annoying me already. I am
			the Duke of Edinburgh, you know! And Laird of Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles. I could make things difficult for him.
			As for the entertainments, oh, I don't know. Baldrick, you've got a beard: go and get yourself a nice dress.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, great, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He is delighted at this splendid opportunity.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: THE GREAT HAIL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A small banquet is laid out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			<i>(Standing up)</i> A toast, Mother, to Father's return!<br />
			<br />
			<i>There are hoofbeats outside, followed by the mighty entrance of McAngus actually on a horse. He dismounts.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Noble Harry, Prince of Wales, Dougal McAngus places at your feet the spoils of an enemy at war.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shakes his bag and a head falls out.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, no, sorry: that's my overnight hag here, behold treasures torn from the torsos of the Turks.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shakes another bag and various treasures fall out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Oh, McAngus, it fills me with joy and hope to see you. What news of the king?<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			When we parted, he said he would return by St Leonard's Day or die in the attempt.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Then we pray for his return: join us, join us, you must be starving.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			What about young Lochnivar?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Ah, yes, him too.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Come on, boy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He brings the horse to the table, leaps over to Edmund's seat and they both start to feed.</i><br />
			<br />
			And you must be the king's bit of rumpy-pumpy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I am the queen.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Aye, aye. I've got a message for you. My father sends you his regards.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, do I know him?<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			<i>(Insinuating)</i> Well, you might say that. He's the third Duke of Argyll.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen jumps at the sound of his name.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Her embarrassment is covered by a little tweak on the trumpets. Edmund enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Ah, and here's Edmund. This, McAngus, is the man who is providing the entertainments for us tomorrow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Ah, the eunuch! Pleased to meet you. There's a groat for your trouble.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I'm not a eunuch.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			You sound like one to me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I am not a eunuch. I am the Duke of Edinburgh.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Oh, you are, are you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			<i>(To the queen)</i> Same old story, eh? Duke of Edinburgh and about as Scottish as the Queen of England's tits.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund squeals a bit.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, no offence. Sorry, your Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I'm sorry: you're in my chair.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Don't apologize.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund kneels at the other side of the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Well, now we've all got to know each other, I've got rather a special announcement to make.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Don't tell me. You are a eunuch as well?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			McAngus, as reward for your heroic deeds in battle, my father here empowers me to grant you anything you may
			desire of me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(To the horse)</i> If he's got any sense, he'll ask for a haircut.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			My lord, I am honoured: all I ask you for is a scrap of land: grant me fair Selkirk and the noble shire of Roxburgh.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Stands)</i> What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Very well. By the power vested in me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah, excuse me ... I'm sorry to dip my little fly in your ointment, but those lands do in fact belong to me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He doesn't see the problem.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, so perhaps he'd like to choose somewhere else.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			McAugus?<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			No, no, I'll have Roxburgh and Selkirk.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			But that leaves me with Peebles!<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Oh, and Peebles!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Urgh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Splendid. Are you trying to say something, Edmund?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, I don't know. <i>(Utter frustration)</i> I mean, some people might say, 'Well what an absurd idea, giving
			half of Scotland to a kilted maniac for slaughtering a couple of syphilitic Turks' .<br />
			<br />
			<i>McAngus grabs Edmund by the neck.</i><br />
			<br />
			... but no, au contraire, I say, let's reward him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Good, good. So be it. Granted.<br />
			<br />
			<i>McAngus shakes Prince Harry's hand and twists Edmund's collar. Edmund squeaks out his response.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund enters in a rage. Percy and Baldrick are in his room. Baldrick is in drag doing a turn.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I'm going to kill him. And I'm going to kill him now.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Who, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			That stinking Scottish weasel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Why, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Because he's a thieving, stinking Scottish weasel.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			How?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I'm going to stab him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Where?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			In the Great Hall and in the bladder.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He sharpens his knife.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			But if you stab him in front of everybody, won't they suspect?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, a drawback. Perhaps we need something ... a little more cunning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I have a cunning plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, perhaps, but I think I have a more cunning one.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He looks through the scrolls, which are still on the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Mine's pretty cunning, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, but not cunning enough, I imagine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, it depends how cunning you mean, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, I mean pretty damn cunning. How cunning do you think I mean?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Mine's <i>quite</i> cunning, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			All right then, let's hear it, let's hear what's so damn cunning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, first of all you get him to come with you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, yes, very cunning, brilliantly cunning, I ask him to come with me and then stab him perhaps. How cunning
			can you get?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, my lord, you get this enormous great cannon ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, I see, take him outside, get him to stick his head down a cannon, then blow it off. Oh yes, Baldrick, that's
			a wonderful idea. No ... I think I have a plan that will give us a little more ... entertainment ... heh-heh-heh.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He goes to the window and looks out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE COURTYARD OUTSIDE THE CASTLE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>McAngus is in the courtyard of the palace. Edmund sees him out of the window. McAngus rides off, out into
			the snowy woods.<br />
			<br />
			Edmund appears in the courtyard as the queen rides up. He pushes her off her horse, and climbs on.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE A GLADE IN THE WOODS NEARBY</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>McAngus arrives at the wood, and dismounts. Edmund is following him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: A WOOD NEAR THE CASTLE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>McAngus is hunting in the wood. Edmund arrives nearby, sees his horse, dismounts and creeps up behind him.
			As he gets closer, he steps into a noose round his ankle, which swiftly leaves him dangling upside down from a
			tree. McAngus does not even turn round, but carries on skinning the animal he's just caught.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Can I help you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ehm, no, no, I'm fine, thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I'm not in your way over here, am I?<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			There is one thing, I was wondering if you could do me a favour?<br />
			<br />
			<i>McAngus stands up, and goes over to Edmund, who is still hanging upside down.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Uh ... huh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I was wondering if you could help us with the celebrations tonight?<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			What, by staying away, do you mean?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes an axe and suddenly cuts the rope. Edmund falls to the ground.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			The thing is, we are presenting a mystery play by one of our leading thespianic troupes, but unfortunately one
			of their number is ill and I thought you'd be the perfect person to take his place.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Hah. Well, I warn you, I'm no actor.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He plunges a knife casually into a passing badger.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, there won't actually be much acting required. It's an ancient Egyptian piece called the Death of the Scotsman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			All right then, I'll have a crack at it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He throws his knife again and there is a squawk.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And you can play the Scotsman, if you like, who dies at the end of the play.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Acting dead. Now that I <i>can</i> do.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He walks off to see what he has killed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(More to himself than to McAngus)</i> Yes, well, as I say, there may not be much acting required.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns and walks away.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Oh, and mind the weasel pit.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Too late. Edmund disappears into a hole in the ground.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The Jumping Jews are on stage, performing a routine of great pointlessness and aimlessness: mainly hopping.
			In fact, that's it. They hop a bit.<br />
			<br />
			The audience has just finished a large feast: there is food and drink everywhere.<br />
			<br />
			The queen and Prince Harry are looking pained, but trying to enjoy themselves.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWELVE: BACKSTAGE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The Jumping Jews can still be heard onstage. Edmund appears, looking furtive, and carrying a bundle which
			he puts down on the table. There are three knives already lying there; he picks up one and tests it: it is
			retractable. He grimaces evilly and opens his bundle, which contains three apparently similar knives. Percy
			appears and takes the old knives away, then Edmund picks up one of the new knives and stabs it into the
			table. It does not retract.<br />
			<br />
			He hears voices and is struggling to remove the knife when three men, dressed as Egyptians, enter.<br />
			<br />
			It is Sir Dominic and two of his troupe of articulating actors, warming up by pretending to be trees, crouching
			on the ground and springing up as they walk in a line.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Sir Dominic</b><br />
			Tall as a tree! Let's see those branches waving and swaying in the breeze! Tall, taller! Now small, smaller.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Sir Dominic! Have you made the necessary changes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sir Dominic</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>McAngus enters, wearing an Egyptian headdress too.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			McAngus: meet your murderers!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The actors are pretending to be trees growing tall. McAngus looks unimpressed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THIRTEEN: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Back to the Jews again: it is the climax of their routine. They perform the first irregular movement, turn a
			bit on one of their hops, and then stop and bow.<br />
			<br />
			The audience claps half-heartedly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOURTEEN: BACKSTAGE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The Jews are coming offstage.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Second Egyptian</b><br />
			How did it go?<br />
			<br />
			<i>One of the Jews takes off his big beard to reveal his own smaller beard.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Jew</b><br />
			Not <i>bad:</i> I don't think they really understood it, though.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIFTEEN: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The audience is clapping, politely.<br />
			<br />
			The three Egyptians take to the stage with classical panache: they are very noble and conspiratorial.<br />
			<br />
			Backstage McAngus swigs some wine.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Sir Dominic</b><br />
			We three are gathered with most bold intent.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Second Egyptian</b><br />
			Here by the banks of the graceful Nile.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Sir Dominic</b><br />
			Where camels ride and deserts blow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Third Egyptian</b><br />
			To spill the blood of this Scotsman vile.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen and Prince Harry are puzzled.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			What's a Scotsman doing in Egypt?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			I'm not sure: but apparently they've had very good reviews.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIXTEEN: BACKSTAGE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>McAngus and Edmund are watching the audience.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Heh, heh. See your mother there. I met my father on my way back through France: apparently he and her
			used to whey-hey-hey ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>That's a delicate sexual euphemism.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, don't be absurd. Such activities are totally beyond my mother. My father only got anywhere with her
			because he told her it was a cure for diarrhoea.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Don't you believe it. There are some letters I found in my father's tent - and, by God, they're hot stuff. I
			tell you they certainly cast a wee shadow of doubt over the parenthood of young Harry for a start!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Look, don't be absur ... what?<br />
			<br />
			<i>His life may be on the point of changing for ever.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVENTEEN: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Second Egyptian</b><br />
			A bagpipe strums. Behold this way our victim comes, For never was there tyrant, This dusty desert here amid
			As him born beneath the shadow of yonder mighty ... Ben Nevis.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHTEEN: BACKSTAGE</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Oh, that's my cue: I'm on.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He starts towards the stage.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Frantic)</i> Letters? Letters? Where are these letters?<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Och, they're hidden away. I'll show you them later.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			All right.<br />
			<br />
			<i>McAngus exits on to the stage. Edmund realizes his mistake. If his plan works, McAngus will be dead in
			about two minutes.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINETEEN: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>McAngus enters, and is greeted by the Egyptians.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Third Egyptian</b><br />
			Tutankhamun Macpherson, you come not a whit too soon. Say: is not the weather fair for this, the Ides
			of June?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He nudges McAngus.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Aye, it is. What business do you mean? Delay me not, for I am hound for Aberdeen.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY: BACKSTAGE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund rushes up to Percy and Baldrick, who are watching the action onstage.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Quick! Help! Oh, my God! McAngus is going to die,<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			And not a moment too soon, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Carrot-faced orang-utan!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Thieving Scots weasel!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick and Percy</b><br />
			Death to the Scot!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, look, he knows too much.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>That</i> is why he must die!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No! He mustn't! He mustn't - he has vital information ... I've changed my mind ... Oh, my God, what are
			we going to do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Stop the show, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			How? How?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well just say 'Stop!'<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund is getting extremely flustered now.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What's our reason? What's our reason for stopping the show?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Because the knives are real and McAngus is just about to get killed.<br />
			<br />
			<i>No</i> - he can't take the stupidity any more.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, you bastard.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund leaps at Percy and stabs him with the retractable knife. At which point the penny drops ...
			Edmund knows what he must do. The play is reaching the climax. There is not a second to lose.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord: quick!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund suddenly galvanizes himself, grabs a makeshift headdress and leaps on
			to the stage with a false knife.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-ONE: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The actors have their knives poised, ready to stab McAngus. Edmund leaps in front of them.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Stop! Sorry I'm late.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He stabs McAngus with the retractable knife. McAngus doesn't act dead, so he stabs him again. He is
			unmoved, so Edmund, exasperated, pushes him over.<br />
			<br />
			It's not good drama, but at least McAngus is still alive.<br />
			<br />
			There is halfhearted, polite clapping; Prince Harry looks relieved that it's over.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-TWO: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A bit later that plotty night Edmund is sitting at the table with McAngus. He is reading the promised,
			saucy letters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Good, good. Excellent. It's certainly my mother's writing. When did you say these were written?<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			1460.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			The year my brother was born. Heh, heh! Baldrick, get in here.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters, still in drag.</i><br />
			<br />
			Get out there and tell everyone the rest of the entertainments have been cancelled.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Why?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>Why?</i> Because I've told you to, you sniveling little rat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, why have they been cancelled, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, I see. Because I have a very important announcement to make.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Does that mean I have to take the dress off?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, get out! Get out!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick leaves. Blackadder laughs manically.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			You know, if you played your cards right, you could be king.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, one day.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			It might be sooner than you think: last time I saw your father, he'd just charged into Constantinople when
			they shut the gates on him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No!<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Yes: there were ten thousand of the Turks in there, armed with scimitars. And your father with a small knife
			for peeling fruit.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, God!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Rut he smiles.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-THREE: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Onstage a man is shooing chickens.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Jerry Merryweather - another nail in the coffin of variety.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I liked Bernard the Rabbit Baiter.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund appears on stage.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Thank you, thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Is this announcement going to take long, Edmund? I haven't seen hide nor hair of a eunuch yet.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund steps up onto the table, followed by Percy, who is carrying the letters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, don't worry, Harry: it will soon all be over. My dear mother, my dear brother; Lords and Ladies of the
			Court. Today there came into my possession from the hands, my lord, of your faithful servant Dougal McAngus,
			certain letters - rather <i>extraordinary</i> letters - concerning the lineage of Prince Harry.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen begins to turn a pleasant shade of scarlet.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Letters? What's so extraordinary about them?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Letters?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well. They were written, Harry, by your mother. To ... your father!<br />
			<br />
			<i>An immediate relaxation in the atmosphere, some laughter, some chatter.</i><br />
			<br />
			Your father, Harry, being of course Donald, Third Duke of Argyll.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry is totally outraged.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			I beg your pardon?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			These letters are of quite an intimate nature.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy is handing him samples of the letters.</i><br />
			<br />
			Let me give you an example.. . Arundel, Thursday. 'My dear hairy-wairy. Often as you sit at the table with
			my husband probing deeply into the affairs of state, I long for the day when you will probe . .<br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen faints. Prince Harry leaps up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Edmund, are you sure you know what you're saying?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy hands Edmund another letter.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			As sure as our mother was, Harry, when she wrote these words: 'Dear Bigboy, sail south. As you know, your
			galleon is always assured a warm welcome in <i>my</i> harbour.'<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy is mouthing the words of the letter along with Edmund. He loves this stuff<br />
			<br />
			There is a moan from the queen.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Bigboy! Mother, do you know anything about this?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			What chance did I have? I was just a little foreign girl.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Then I must renounce the Regency: and hie me to a monastery. Edmund, you shall be regent until your
			father returns.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			The king will not be returning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			<i>(Not upset at all)</i> Oh, dear!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, the last time McAngus saw him he was facing half the Turkish army armed only with a small piece of
			cutlery ... Percy, if you'd like to start things off.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund walks down the table and off and up to the throne.<br />
			<br />
			Percy starts chanting and everyone gradually joins in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy and others</b><br />
			The king is dead! Long live the king.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry is leaving, but he turns around and observes sternly</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			<i>Probably</i> dead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			The king is probably dead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			The king is probably dead, long live the king. The king is probably dead, long live the king.<br />
			<br />
			<i>At which moment, trumpets sound and the king bursts through the doors, a battered, bloody, but vibrant
			man.<br />
			<br />
			Percy creeps up to join Edmund by the throne.</i><br />
			<br />
			The king is ... not dead. Long live the king. Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The king stands, arms and legs akimbo, waving a spear.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Blood! Death! War! Rumpy-pumpy! Triumph! McAngus! <i>(McAngus leaps up to the king)</i> My companion
			in blood and most trusted friend.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			You made it!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Yes! I made it. Thanks to my trusty fruit knife.<br />
			<br />
			<i>As he says this he looks around and notices for the first time that things are looking unsettled and
			Edmund is sitting on the throne.</i><br />
			<br />
			Wait a minute: what's going on here? Who are you?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He climbs on to the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			It's our son.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			What? Oh, yes, of course ... Enid.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			My beloved father, certain letters have just come to light which I think might ... change things a bit.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Letters, what letters?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, they speak of acts of love between your wife and Donald, the Gay Dog of the Glens: 'How I long to
			be in that kingdom between the saffron sheets where you and your ruler are the only ruler.'<br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen faints again.</i><br />
			<br />
			... and then acts of love consummated: 'Oh, you enormous Scotsman' etc., and these letters are dated
			November and December 1460, which, Harry, in relation to your date of birth is precisely nine months ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He is staring at Prince Harry with a look that seems to suddenly contain a hint of panic. There is a pause.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			... after I was born.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Utter shock registers on Edmund</i> 'c face. He cannot believe it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			But about nine months before your birth, Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a pause as Edmund slowly turns to McAngus with a look of complete fury and inward despair.
			He says rather quietly and calmly</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			You bastard!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			No, I think you're the bastard, Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Silence! I will have an explanation.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Improvising)</i> My liege, the reason I have gathered you all here today is to try to get some proper
			justice meted out <i>(rising to a crescendo)</i> against this Scottish turd who has clearly forged these
			obviously fake letters.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Let me see them .<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I rip them up in his face so no hint of their filthy slander can remain.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He tears up the letters and throws them into the fire.</i><br />
			<br />
			You come in here, fresh from slaughtering a couple of chocos when their backs were turned, and you think
			you can upset the harmony of a whole kingdom? I challenge you <i>(throwing down his gauntlet) ...</i>
			to a duel!<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			To the death!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ermmmmmm ... yes, all right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Excellent idea: after all it is St Leonard's Day: there's meant to be some entertainment.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The king leaps off the table. This is his kind of fun.</i><br />
			<br />
			Take your places!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund produces his fine épée. Two seconds later, McAngus produces his enormous broadsword. There
			is despair in Edmund %face. McAngus and the king are joshing like old friends, the king comparing his fruit
			knife with McAngus's sword.</i><br />
			<br />
			Good to see old Glenshee again, McAngus.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Yes, my lord: remember the night with Glenshee and the Turk and the human kebab!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Yes, how could I forget it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund looks on in panic.</i><br />
			<br />
			Very well: let the killing begin!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Silence falls. Edmund waves his elegant épée around with purpose, trying to look threatening. McAngus
			tolerates this for a minute, then brings his heavy sword down, breaking Edmund's feeble instrument in two.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Right now, let's see the Black Adder wriggle out of this one.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He draws his sword back against Edmund's neck for the kill.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, wait!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Come on, what's the hold-up?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I'll give you everything I own. Everything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Uh-huh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes. I'm hardly a rich man.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			You're hardly a man at all!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			But my horse must he worth a thousand ducats. I can sell my wardrobe, the pride of my life, my swords,
			my curtains, my socks, and my fighting cocks, my servants I can live without, except perhaps he who oils
			my rack. And then, my most intimate treasures. My collection of antique cod-pieces. My wigs for state
			occasions, my wigs for private occasions, and my wigs for humorous occasions. My collection of pokers,
			my grendle stretchers - my ornamental pomfries. And, of course, my autographed miniature of Judas Iscariot.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. <i>(He laughs loud and long)</i> No: that's nowhere near enough.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He rises to strike and then stops.</i><br />
			<br />
			I'm only kidding: (Quietly) I'm quite interested in the wigs.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The fight is over. McAngus is satisfied with the deal. Percy and Baldrick scramble to Edmund's aid.</i><br />
			<br />
			I hope life doesn't get too dull for you, not being able to pass laws over Scotland any more. Ha-ha!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(To himself)</i> Yes. Ha ha ha ha. I wouldn't pass water over Scotland.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-FOUR: THE BAY WINDOW</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The king is sitting in the bay window looking out and muttering. Prince Harry stands by him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			We're so pleased you're back, Father.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			I'm not. I miss the smell of blood in my nostrils, and the queen's got a headache.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			But we do have a fascinating week ahead. The Archbishop of York has asked me if you'd care to join his
			Italian formation dancing class, and I really ought to give him an answer.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Do you want me to be honest or tactful?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Oh, tactful, I think.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Tell him to get stuffed! Has that little hooligan McAngus left?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			No, Edmund's just giving him a last look around the castle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWENTY-FIVE: THE RAMPARTS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund and McAngus are now the very best of mates. Edmund is giving him a tour of the castle. They
			inspect the view, then move on.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			While this ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund points</i> to a large cannon.<br />
			<br />
			<b>McAngus</b><br />
			Yes, very interesting.<br />
			<br />

			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes, so will Edmund. He and McAngus have become quite firm friends.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is the sound of a huge explosion.</i><br />

			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			The drains!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund rushes in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />

			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
