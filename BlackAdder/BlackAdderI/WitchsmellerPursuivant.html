			<b>SCENE ONE: THE TYLER'S HOUSE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Four peasants are eating a hearty meal and conversation is flowing with the mead.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Tyler</b><br />
			What about the plague? Rumours from the north say it's worse there than ever.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Piers</b><br />
			No, no. Now that we've found out about the rats, we'll never have plague again.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Field</b><br />
			You know what they say - a rat a day keeps the plague away.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Piers</b><br />
			Believe me, madam, there'll be no more plague in our lifetime.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mrs Tyler rises to get the pie from the side table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Tyler</b><br />
			Well, I hope you're right.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She picks up the pie, and when she turns back, all her guests have died from the plague. She
			screams and drops the pie.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: COUNTRYSIDE NEAR THE CASTLE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>By the autumn of the Year of Our Lord 1495, the Black Plague once again howled westwards
			across Europe from the Indies, carried by seamen and entering England by the South-west Passage.
			</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Each day, thousands died.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Village after village disappeared in its evil wake, and not even the best and noblest escaped
			its horror.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: CASTLE CORRIDOR</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund is just unhooking a picture of a naked female saint from the wall. Prince Harry comes
			round the corner.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Ah, Edmund, I'm glad I've caught you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Very guilty)</i> Er ... Doing what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			I'm afraid Father's feeling a bit under the weather.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh dear, any idea what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Not sure. I think it's probably Black Death. Nevertheless, I am sure he would appreciate a little
			visit from you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah! Well, I could probably pop my head around the door.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Sort of now-ish.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE KING'S BEDROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen is knitting, guarding the door. Edmund enters the corridor.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(By door)</i> Mother, would you like to ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			No, dear, he won't let me near him.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund goes in - and is greeted by the king, screaming madly and swinging his sword about.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Hlllillllaaaaaahhhhhh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund shoots out and closes the door behind him. A sword smashes through it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			How is he?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, he's up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: A MEETING ROOM IN THE CASTLE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Lords are gathered round the table. Edmund is also there looking a little ill at ease. Percy and
			Baldrick are at his shoulder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry sits at the end of the table, firmly in control of the meeting.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			My lords of the council, we face today the gravest crisis this country has known since the Roman
			Invasion.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lords</b><br />
			Here, here.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Therefore I propose ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>A messenger bursts in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			Your Highness, the king has stirred and calls for you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry gulps and rises.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Very well. Gentlemen, I must leave.<br />
			<br />
			<i>All rise with Prince Harry. It's pretty definite he's facing certain death.</i><br />
			<br />
			Prince Edmund is in charge.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lords</b><br />
			Shame!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry exits with the messenger. The lords look to Edmund with expectation; he beckons
			Baldrick to pick up Prince Harry's papers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahm, right, gentlemen. As you know, we face today the gravest crisis this country has known since
			the Roman Invasion.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lords</b><br />
			Rubbish! Nonsense!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Lindsey</b><br />
			What about the Viking Invasion?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Broxtable</b><br />
			And the Norman Invasion?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Tablett</b><br />
			And the Swiss Invasion?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, the greatest crisis for some time.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Broxtable</b><br />
			And we all know why!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Why?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Tablett</b><br />
			Because ... the king is possessed.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund was totally not expecting this.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Broxtable</b><br />
			True, true, the land is full of omens, of bewitchment. Only last week in Cornwall a man with four
			heads was seen taking tea on the beach, and two women in Windsor claim to have been raped by a fish.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Lindsey</b><br />
			I, too, have heard such tales. In Harrogate it rained phlegm, and in Edinburgh it is said the
			graves did open, and the ghosts of our ancestors rose up and competed in athletic sports.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Other Lords</b><br />
			Horror! Horror! ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, and a friend of mine had this awful pimple inside his nose.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Tablett</b><br />
			A farmer in Rye swears he heard a cow reciting Geoffrey Chaucer, and a girl in Shropshire saw
			Geoffrey Chaucer in a field, mooing and suckling a young heifer.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, gentlemen - surely we aren't the kind of people who believe this sort of thing. I mean,
			start believing this and next you'll be telling me that washing your hair in bat's droppings
			stops you going bald.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Broxtable</b><br />
			It is true. I couldn't find enough bats and look what happened.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He reveals he is bald. Shock from all.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Tablett</b><br />
			I move we do the only thing that we can do to remove this curse from the kingdom.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah yes, well, that sounds like the answer, doesn't it!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Lindsey</b><br />
			Call for ... the Witchsmeller Pursuivant!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Who?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Broxtable</b><br />
			Root out the witches, call for the Smeller!<br />
			<br />
			<i>By now, they are all on their fret, spitting.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Lindsey</b><br />
			The Witchsmeller! Burn, burn, burn!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Tablett</b><br />
			We must inform the Prince of Wales.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They leave, riding a wave of hysteria.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lords</b><br />
			The Witchsmeller! The Witchsmeller! Burn the witches! Send for the Smeller! Burn, burn, burn!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund sees he's lost control. Percy also follows the lords, equally overcome with passion.
			Edmund stops him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Percy. What the devil do you think you're doing?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Look, I just can't take the pressure of all these omens any more.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Percy ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy is almost in tears.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			No, no really, I'm serious. Only this morning in the courtyard I saw a horse with two heads and
			two bodies.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Two horses standing next to each other?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh yes, I suppose it could have been.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Honestly, I suppose you re one of those people who think sticking your finger up a sheep's bottom
			on Good Friday makes you fertile.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That's rubbish.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Precisely.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It's Easter Monday.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes. Remind me not to shake your hand during a religious festival. I don't believe it. I mean, who
			is this Witchsmeller Pursuivant anyway?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I don't know, my lord, but Mistress Scott would.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Of course, the old crone with the cat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, the cat, lovely. But she lives in the village.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			So?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			But everyone's dying of plague.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, that's what they claim. Any excuse for getting out of a decent day's work.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund exits, followed by Percy and Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: THE GATES OF THE TOWN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund, Percy and Baldrick make their way into town stepping over bodies as they go.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, obviously there are some genuine cases.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They pass a pilgrimage of the dead, dying or fleeing. Those who greet Edmund are depressed and
			downtrodden.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>A Peasant</b><br />
			Morning, Prince Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Morning, peasant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Another Peasant</b><br />
			Morning, Prince Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Morning, peasant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Yet Another Peasant</b><br />
			Morning, Prince Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord, shouldn't we disguise? We don't want anyone with a grudge coming up and infecting us on
			purpose, do we?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, you're right.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They dive through a market stall selling clothes. Edmund emerges in his 'disguise': a small
			piece of cloth tied loosely across his face.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Peasant</b><br />
			Morning, stranger.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Morning, friend.<br />
			<br />
			<b>One More Peasant</b><br />
			Morning, stranger.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Morning, friend.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Peasant Number Six</b><br />
			Morning, stranger.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns to the seventh peasant beside him.</i><br />
			<br />
			Who is that dark stranger?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Peasant Number Seven</b><br />
			Oh, that'll be Prince Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Peasant Number Six</b><br />
			Oh yes, course it is.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			This way, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy efficiently lays down his cloak for Edmund on a particularly mucky part of the road.
			Edmund looks at it and steps round it, walking on. Percy picks up his cloak and runs after him.
			They walk through the terrible village and arrive at Mistress Scott's house. There is no sign
			of life coming from the house. The town-crier passes by.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Town-crier</b><br />
			Bring out your de ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He drops dead.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Where's Mistress Scott?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Yet Another Peasant</b><br />
			You've just passed her.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund looks back to see two stakes in the ground. There is a pile of ash at the bottom of
			each stake - one is five foot high, the other one foot high.</i><br />
			<br />
			My God. And this?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			The cat, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(To everyone)</i> Does anyone know what happened?<br />
			<br />
			<i>A peasant raises his hand and looks rather suspicious.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Suspicious Peasant</b><br />
			No, I don't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Thick Peasant</b><br />
			Me neither. I was right on the other side of town when we burned her.<br />
			<br />
			<i>His friend whacks him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Suspicious Peasant</b><br />
			Sssssssssssssh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They are a suspicious pair.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			You burned her! What for?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Suspicious Peasant</b><br />
			I don't know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Thick Peasant</b><br />
			Well, it was because she was a witch, wasn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Suspicious Peasant</b><br />
			Sssssh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			You burned Mistress Scott for being a witch? Why?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Thick Peasant</b><br />
			Can't say. It's a secret.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			A secret! Do you know who I am?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Suspicious Peasant</b><br />
			A stranger.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh yes, that's right. Well, tell me anyway.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Suspicious Peasant</b><br />
			No, we can't. And I'll tell you why, because if you'd been part of a secret committee to invite
			the Witchsmeller Pursuivant into town and he'd already burned four of your best friends, would
			you go telling everyone?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, no, I suppose I wouldn't ... so is it the Witchsmeller Pursuivant who's burned her?<br />
			<br />
			<b>First Peasant</b><br />
			He's guessed!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Another Peasant</b><br />
			He's clever.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			They don't call him Clever Jake for nothing, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, they don't call me Clever Jake. Oh, I see .. . <i>(He realizes he's meant to be in disguise)
			</i> And what does this Witchsmeller man look like?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Yet Another Peasant</b><br />
			No one knows, my lord. No one. He is a master of disguise, and mostly appears only at night. That's
			right, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<i>It suddenly gets darker. At which moment, the Witchsmeller appears, in all his holy terror,
			coal-red eyes glowing beneath his deathly dark cloak.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			I believe so.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			All right, so he won't be around now, but still, let me tell you something: if the so-called
			Witchsmeller burned Mistress Scott ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Deeply moved)</i> And her cat.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Witchsmeller goes and stands next to Edmund, who is oblivious to him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And her cat, then there's something wrong with his nose and I should know - they don't call me
			Clever Pete for nothing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Jake, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What about him?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Clever Jake, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Where?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You're Clever Jake, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh yes, they don't call me Clever Pete at all, they call me Clever Jake. If I were you and I'd
			asked the Witchsmeller into town ... I'd throw the big-nosed bully straight out again. What do
			you think?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns, still totally oblivious to the terrifying figure beside him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			I think it's worth serious consideration.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			There we go. Take Clever Tom's advice and send him back to the madhouse he came from. Come on,
			boys, Mistress Scott is obviously in no state to help us today.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He strides off</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: CASTLE MEETING ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Two hands are visible, one says 'GOOD' on the fingers, the other says 'EVIL'. The Witchsmeller
			is in residence.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			I have two functions: to protect the good ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns over the GOOD hand, to reveal an egg in it.</i><br />
			<br />
			And to crush the evil.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Likewise the EVIL hand, with its own egg.</i><br />
			<br />
			Watch!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He squeezes his hands and both eggs smash.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Fascinating, absolutely fascinating. Um ... actually, you have crushed both eggs, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Some that seem good sometimes proveth to be evil.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A man with a bowl appears behind the Witchsmeller. He turns to wash his hands in it. At that
			moment the door behind him opens and Baldrick enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lords, the Duke of Edinburgh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>And Edmund enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Ah, Edmund. Come in. The Witchsmeller's arrived.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh yes. Old Big-Nose is back, is he?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Witchsmeller turns, a truly nasty piece of work. Edmund hopes he won't be recognized from
			the village episode. Vain, vain hope.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, hello. I'm delighted to meet you. I'm one of your greatest admirers.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			'Old Big-Nose is back'?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes. Old Big-Nose's ... back ... is in a terrible state. I was talking to him just now. He's a great
			admirer of yours as well.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Who's this?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Pointing behind him vaguely)</i> Oh, Old Big-Nose. In fact, I've just been hearing about your
			work in Taunton. Imagine that - every single person in the village having an affair with the same
			duck.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			The Duck of Taunton was a tragic circumstance.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And I hear you very kindly burned our Mistress Scott for us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Oh, yes. And her pussy cat.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy looks upset.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And have you found our chief witch yet?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			I feel I may be very close.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Wooohh. Get the kindling ready! Make sure that stake is well done! Ha ha ha.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Do tell me. If you do happen to come across someone who's a bit ... witchy, you know, how do you
			find him guilty?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			By trial, or by ordeal.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah - the ordeal by water?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			No, by axe.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ooh.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			The suspected witch has his head placed upon a block, and an axe aimed at his neck. If the man is
			guilty, the axe will bounce off his neck. So we burn him. If the man is not guilty, the axe will
			simply slice his head off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What a very fair test that is!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Would you like to attempt a less violent test yourself, your Highness, by way of demonstration?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			How much less violent?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			I place before the suspect a dagger and a crucifix.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			How interesting!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			The suspect is blindfolded. If he picks up the dagger from the table, he is Satan's bedfellow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Oh yes, Edmund, I think you should do it! At least take yourself out of the running!<br />
			Eh?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry is in very high spirits, the occasion is going well, there is no sense of fear and
			the other lords join in the jollity.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Broxtable</b><br />
			I haven't seen your broomstick recently, your Highness!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all laugh.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ha, ha, I'm not sure, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He is frantically checking where the crucifix and dagger are on the table. But now the Witchsmeller
			is behind him and has applied the blindfold.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			You will all notice it has become much darker suddenly.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Everyone turns to the window.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, so it has.<br />
			<br />
			<i>It is indeed darker, but while everyone is turned away, the Witchsmeller swaps the crucifix
			and dagger round.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Choose!<br />
			<br />
			<i>All turn round to watch Edmund lift the dagger confidently from the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			There we are!<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is absolute horror in the room.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Prince Edmund! The witch! Sorcery!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			How the devil did that happen?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Witchsmeller is in a new state of excitement, leaping and prancing in the most horrific
			fashion.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			As I thought, my lord, this man is the source of evil in your kingdom, this is your witch! Behold
			Lucifer's brother! Humble bubbbbbilass jjjjjjjjjkklu peeeeeeeaaaaaaakkkkkk seeee! Burn the witch!
			Burn! Burn!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Sorry, I don't think I quite caught the first part of that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Try him tomorrow and you will know the truth.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Well, if that's what you recommend.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Harry, you can't let him do this!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			He is very highly thought of, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			But he's a quack!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Shocked silence falls.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			What did you say?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I said, 'quack, quack, quack'!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			See how the Duck of Taunton lives within him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes, I'm afraid so. Let him be tried tomorrow.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund's face registers the fact he is in very serious trouble.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE MEETING ROOM</b><br />

			<i>The meeting room has been transformed into a courtroom. The lords and ladies are in one area,

			<br />
			<b>Officer</b><br />
			Lords and ladies of England, this court is summoned to adjudge the most heinous of all crimes,
			that of witchcraft.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A lady screams and faints.</i><br />
			<br />
			All the more heinous this day as the accused is a Prince of the Realm. Step forward Edmund,
			Duke of Edinburgh.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund gets up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Peasant</b><br />
			Look at his hair!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Peasant's Wife</b><br />
			Yes, the hair proves it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Rather unfair, that - it's just Edmund's usual styling.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Officer</b><br />
			Who will defend the accused ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy stands up and smiles graciously.</i><br />
			<br />
			And thus condemn himself to certain burning at the stake as a partner in Satan if the accused
			is found guilty?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy sits down.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Lord Percy will defend his Royal Highness.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh yes, me, sorry, yes, hello.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Witchsmeller suddenly enters, his hatred now turned on to Percy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Witch! Witch! Witch!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Peasant</b><br />
			Yes, look at his hair.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Peasant's Wife</b><br />
			The hair proves it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Will you force us to listen to the pleadings of a man who may be a witch himself?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			No, you're absolutely right. Well, that concludes the case for the defence. Thank you, Lord
			Percy. Let the Prosecutor begin.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Prince Edmund, are you a Christian?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, of course I am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Can you say the Lord's Prayer?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I can say it backwards, if you like.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Confession!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Everyone claps.</i><br />
			<br />
			Edmund, you have, I believe, a cat?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller and Crowd</b><br />
			Ah ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Its name is Bubbles?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller and Crowd</b><br />
			Ah ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Or, to give it its full name, BEEZLEBUBBLES!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Huge screams.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Eh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Do you deny that you were seen on the feast of St Jacob the Turgid speaking to this same cat,
			Bubbles?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Of course I deny it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			But the chambermaid, Mary, heard you saying, and I quote: 'Hello, little Bubbles, would you
			like some milk?'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I might have said that.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Aha ha ha! What did you mean by that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I meant, would the cat like some milk?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Milk, what did you mean by 'milk'?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I meant milk, bloody milk.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Bloody milk! A mixture of milk and blood.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Crowd</b><br />
			Ahhhh ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>The hysteria is building. This man is guilty.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, just milk.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			The blood was to come later.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			There wasn't any blood.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			<i>(Shouting)</i> So you had to make do with milk! <i>(General gasps from the crowd)</i> Let
			us move on, my lord. You have a horse called Black Satin?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			And do you confess that on the thirteenth day of Jerebothstide you did say unto this horse
			Black Satin, and I quote: 'Satin, would you like some carrots?'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, I might have done. He likes carrots.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Carrots!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, carrots.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			But, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that carrots are the devil's favourite food.<br />
			<br />
			<i>All agree.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Leaping to his feet)</i> Er, no, we don't! If the devil likes carrots, why isn't it
			mentioned in the Bible, then? Why doesn't it say: 'And he took the Lord up to the top of an
			high mountain and offered him a carrot'?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Or why isn't 'Thou shalt not eat carrots' in the Ten Commandments?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			It is!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Cheers from the crowd.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Witchsmeller takes out a holy book.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			The Ten Commandments of Jereboth in the Appendix to the Apocrypha: 'And the Lord said unto the
			children of Bednebott, "Neither shalt thou eat the fruit of the tree that is known as the carrot
			tree".'<br />
			<br />
			<i>He closes the book and slams it down on the podium.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But carrots don't grow on trees.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Really! And how did you get to know so much about carrots? Ha! Ha! Witch!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick's in it now too.</i><br />
			<br />
			My lord, I call my first. witness.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns to reveal that Black Satin is in the witness box.</i><br />
			<br />
			Satin. Just relax. You are amongst friends. Good. Now, tell me, in your own words, did you,
			Satin, on a certain night last Jerebothstide indulge, albeit I accept quite innocently, in
			frenzied, naked and obscene Satanic orgies with your master, known to you as the Great
			Grumbledook?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Silence, Grumbledook! You are not replying, Satin. My lord, are we to assume this horse has
			something to hide?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Either that or he can't talk.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			A likely story. Black Satin, known in the hierarchy of evil as Black Satin the Loquacious.
			Are you, or are you not, a servant of Satan?<br />
			<br />
			<i>A man screams and faints. The horse neighs, many scream.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Sorry, was that a yea or a neigh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			A neigh, my lord, but I don't believe a word of it. I call for a recess. <i>(He turns on
			the horse)</i> He may think he can fool us, but we have ways of making him talk!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Many screams.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: THE PRISON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund is in prison. His mother is talking through the bars of his cell.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, I suppose this is what comes of being a witch.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Mother, I'm not a witch.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, Edmund, you always were a bit of a fibber.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Mother, I beg of you, use whatever power you have to help me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Mmmmm. I haven't had any power for years, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, but father's sick. You must do something, otherwise .<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Otherwise what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Otherwise I'll be burned.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh yes. Oh yes, this would be a pity.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Thanks.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, I'll see if I can sort out something.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen leaves, Percy and Baldrick emerge from the shadows.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			My lord, I had an idea how to get out of this.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Send for all the greatest lawyers in the land, and they could save you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Brilliant, contact them at once.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I've already done it, my lord!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Are those the replies?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ah, yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Read them.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ahm ... very well. Robert Wyatt writes from Somerset: 'What you ask is against reason and
			God. I spit on you and your master, and look forward to passing water over both your graves
			at a later date.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What does that one say?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It's from John Watts.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Relieved)</i> Oh, Stinker Watts!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			'Dear Percy, of course I remember being at school with Prince Edmund and yourself, and so was
			very interested by your letter. ..'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			'May you both die horribly. Yours, John Watts.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh no, I'm doomed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Maybe not, my lord. I have a cunning plan that cannot fail.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What is it?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They huddle. Two guards appear and obscure our heroes as they hatch their plan.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Guard One</b><br />
			My wife wondered if you'd like to come to dinner tonight?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guard Two</b><br />
			No, thanks.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guard One</b><br />
			Why not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guard Two</b><br />
			The food always tastes like manure, and frankly I find you both very boring.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guard One</b><br />
			Oh, fair enough, then. How about next Thursday?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guard Two</b><br />
			That's fine by me.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They walk away to reveal Edmund, Baldrick and Percy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Brilliant, brilliant. Ha ha. Well done, Baldrick, very cunning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Thank you, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			You may capture the eagle, but you cannot clip its wings.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The guards enter once more and stand in front of Edmund, Percy and Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Guard One</b><br />
			By the way, how's that eagle of yours?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guard Two</b><br />
			Fine. Had a bit of trouble at first, but now I've clipped its wings, no problem.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guard One</b><br />
			Glad to hear it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They walk off again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Tomorrow I shall not be so meek. Heh, heh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: THE COURT</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The trial has recommenced. Edmund is looking very self-assured now. He is hissed at by
			the crowd, but he, Baldrick and Percy hiss back.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			My lord, unhappily, the horse, blessed Satin the Confessor, who was to have been our first
			witness today.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Cannot be with us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Oh.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			However, before he died ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			You bastard!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			He made this signed confession. I will read it to you: 'I, Black Satin, confess that my
			former master Edmund is the servant of Satan, and I spoke to him on the matter frequently
			over a gallon' - a gallon! - 'a gallon of stableboy's blood.'<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Witchsmeller turns around full circle showing the confession to the horrified crowd.
			He reveals a hoofmark signature. Lots of screams and fainting.</i><br />
			<br />
			My lord, this tragic, horrid, nasty and most evil case draws to an end. In pursuing this
			end I call my last witness.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Loud cheers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What is it? A cow? A talkative badger? An easily bribed ant?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Call Jane Firkettle.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Jane Firkettle enters. She is an amiable old lady.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Jane Firkettle, do you know the man standing before you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Jane</b><br />
			Which?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			That's him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Jane</b><br />
			Of course I recognize him.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She waves and blows big kisses.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			She's seen me on a coin.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			And have you or have you not committed sins of the flesh with him?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Jane</b><br />
			I have.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			You must be joking.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Jane</b><br />
			To my deep shame.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			And mine. I mean, look at her.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Can you describe these foul deeds?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Jane</b><br />
			Yes. After we had just kissed once, he transformed into a wild animal.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Or perhaps I do remember her.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Anything else?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Jane</b><br />
			Yes, my lord. Three months later, I was great with child.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, for God's sake!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			And did you give birth to a son?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Jane</b><br />
			I did. My little Johnny.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			And do you see this son of Satan anywhere in court?<br />
			<br />
			<i>One by one, the spectators shake their heads - including a friendly-looking red man dressed
			in black with horns on his head, sitting among them. But where is the son? Finally, the
			Witchsmeller produces a small white poodle.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Jane</b><br />
			Yes, that's him.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Huge screams from the crowd.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			I give you John Grumbledook!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Tablett</b><br />
			Yes, look at his hair.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Broxtable</b><br />
			His hair gives him away.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, come on - he doesn't look a bit like me!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Of course he does, my lord. I give you three proofs of witchcraft. A cat that drinks blood,
			a horse that talks, and a man who propagates poodles. These men must burn.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Crowd</b><br />
			Burn! Burn. Burn! Let the witches fry!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Officer</b><br />
			Silence. Silence for the Prince of Wales!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry stands.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			The verdict of this court is that the accused are guilty of witchcraft. The maximum penalty
			the law allows is to be burned to death. However, in view of your previous good background I
			am disposed to be lenient. I therefore sentence you to be burned alive. <i>(Cheers)</i> Do
			you have anything to say?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund is smiling, resigned to all this madness. Percy decides to fight back.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, yes I'd certainly like to say something!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Shut up, Percy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy changes his mind.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			No, thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			And you, Grumbledook?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes. <i>Now!</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>As one, Percy, Baldrick and Edmund raise their arms and jump in the air.</i><br />

			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahm, yes, I have erred and strayed like a lost ox.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Sheep!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah yes, sheep, sheep. I have coveted my father's adultery.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Get on with it!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I have not always honoured my neighbour's ass.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			<i>(Annoyed)</i> Oh, light the fires!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They do.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I'm a witch, I'm a witch.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			And so am I!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Me, too!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			Too late.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The crowd cheer as they go up in flames.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh damn! I'm not even comfortable.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He wriggles a little and drops the doll his mum gave him, which has been pressing into
			his back. The doll hits the fire. And suddenly, spookily, the Witchsmeller starts to look
			unhappy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			How fast the heat travels!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes, it is rather warm, isn't it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			I feel as if I am on fire!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He's right. His body has actually started smoking.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes, I'm rather regretting my own choice of undergarments, too.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And the Witchsmeller explodes into flames.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Witchsmeller</b><br />
			I am burning, burning!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes, but I bet you're jolly glad of that cloak in winter.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Witchsmeller staggers away, in flames. He collapses. He dies. The earth is free of
			its vilest scourge.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Good Lord!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Suddenly, the fire on the pyre dies down and Edmund, Baldrick and Percy's ropes fall
			off them.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahm ... well done, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, that was a close shave. Well done, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is not quite so sure how he is responsible for this miracle.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIFTEEN: OUTSIDE THE KING'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The doors of the king's room are thrown open. The king appears, clearly perfectly well,
			doing a healthy stretch to greet the bright new dawn.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen is sitting with her tapestry in the window, and Leia is standing on the seat,
			looking out of the window keenly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Morning, my love!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Ah! Good morning, dear.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Morning, Princess!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Leia</b><br />
			Good morning!<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			What's going on out there?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Leia</b><br />
			Well, Uncle Harry was going to burn Edmund alive, when ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Darling, sssh! <i>(To the king)</i> Nothing, my dear: it's all sorted out now.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Oh, good.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen winks and wrinkles her nose. Stars fly out of it. Leia turns and sees this -
			she looks amazed. There 's something bewitching going on here.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIXTEEN: OUTSIDE THE CASTLE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy, Baldrick and Edmund arrive back in the castle. Two guards lift their pikes.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I said he shouldn't have burnt that cat.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And the Blackadder Three walk on to freedom.</i>
