			<H1>The Foretelling</H1>
			<i>History has known many great liars.<br />
			<br />
			Copernicus. Goebbels. St Ralph the Liar. But there have been none quite so vile as the Tudor king, Henry VII.<br />
			<br />
			It was he who rewrote history to portray his predecessor Richard III as a deformed maniac, who killed his nephews
			in the Tower.<br />
			<br />
			But the truth is that Richard was a kind and thoughtful man who cherished his young wards, in particular Richard,
			Duke of York, who grew into a big strong boy.<br />
			<br />
			Henry also claimed he won the Battle of Bosworth Field, and killed Richard III.<br />
			<br />
			Again, the truth is very different. For it was Richard, Duke of York, who became king after Bosworth Field and
			reigned for thirteen glorious years.<br />
			<br />
			As for who really killed Richard III and how the defeated Henry Tudor escaped with his life, all is revealed in
			this, the first chapter of a history never before told: the History of ... the Black Adder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ONE: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The eve of the Rattle of Bosworth Field, 21 August 1485.<br />
			<br />
			A vast room with bare stone walls and a flagstone floor. Light filters down from the windows set high up. A couple
			of rich tapestries hang. Very sparse on decoration: a few candelabras are lit.<br />
			<br />
			Various nobles and lords are gathered for a great feast. Richard III is addressing an enthusiastic gathering of
			lords. On his left sits Richard, Duke of York, a huge man with an enormous beard, who will soon be king, and his
			son, Prince Harry.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Silence. Silence for the king.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Now is the summer of our sweet content made overcast winter by these Tudor clouds. And I, that am not shaped for
			blackfac'd war ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lords</b><br />
			Shame.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			I that am rudely cast and want true majesty ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lords</b><br />
			Never!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Am forced to fight to keep sweet England free. I pray to heaven we fare well. And all who fight us, go to hell!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lords</b><br />
			Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Hurray! Absolutely, hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund is the Duke of York's second son, a scoundrel with a stupid haircut. He sits miles away at the far end
			of the table. His over-enthusiasm leaves an embarrassed silence, before a general heartiness is resumed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Who is that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			I know not, my lord. I'll ask my son. Harry! Who is that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			It is your other son, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			It is my other son, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Fights he with us on the morrow?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			<i>(To Prince Harry)</i> What's his name?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			<i>(Quietly)</i> Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Edna! Fight you with us on the morrow?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, goodness no; I'll be fighting with the enemy. Ha! Ha! Ha!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He sits down. No one else laughs. They never do.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			You're not putting him anywhere near me, are you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			No, Uncle. He will be somewhere with the rabble.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Oh. Arrow fodder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Precisely.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Richard III smiles and waves at Edmund. Then says under his breath.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			What a little turd!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund waves back enthusiastically, and addresses the very foolish fellow beside him, Lord Percy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Hah. Percy, you see how the king picked me out for a special greeting?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy is the closest thing to a friend that Edmund has.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			No, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick interposes his head between them. He's short, scruffy and, unexpectedly, quite clever</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			<i>I</i> saw it, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah. And what is your name, little fellow?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My name is Baldrick, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well then, I shall call you 'Baldrick'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			And I shall call you my lord, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I like the cut of your jib, young feller-me-lad. How'd you like to be my squire at the battle tomorrow?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick goes down on one knee, deeply honored.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			It will be a great day tomorrow for we nobles.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ha! Already I can hear the sound of battle ringing in my ears!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shoots a superior look at Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, not if we lose, Percy. If we lose, I'll be chopped to pieces. My arm'll end up in Essex, my torso in
			Norfolk and my genitalia stuck up a tree somewhere in Rutland.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, my lord. With yon at the helm, we cannot lose!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, we <i>could</i> if we wanted to.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, we won't, Percy, and I shall prove to all that I am a man.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			But you are a man, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			But how shall it be proved, Percy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, they could look up that tree in Rutland!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund thumps Percy on the head.</i><br />
			<br />
			Ow! Not in front of the staff, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			It shall be proved by my enemies rushing to the water closet in terror.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			So come, a toast! <i>(They all perk up)</i> Let all men who go to don armour tomorrow remember to go
			before they don armour tomorrow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy and Baldrick</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They clink glasses, a terrible trio, bonded for all time.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE COUNTRYSIDE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>On the brow of the hill over Bosworth Field, the three proud leaders - Richard III, the Duke of York
			and Prince Harry -deliver their battle orations to their loudly cheering troops. The sky behind their
			noble figures bristles with flags, spears and excitement.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more. Consign their parts most private to a Rutland tree.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Let blood, blood, blood be your motto. Slit their gizzards!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Now, I'm afraid there's going to have to be a certain amount of violence, but at least we know it's in a
			good cause, don't we?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			And gentlemen in London now abed Shall think themselves accursed they were not here. And hold their
			manhoods cheap while others speak. Who fought with us 'pon Ralph the Liar's day!<br />
			<br />
			<i>A huge cry resounds across the countryside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund's bedroom is quite a pleasant, light room in one of the castle towers. Edmund is fast asleep in
			his heavily tapestried, four-poster bed, snoring interestingly. Baldrick is fast asleep on the floor next
			to Edmund's bed. There is a knock at the door. The queen enters in a very merry mood.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			<i>(Gaily)</i> Edmund? Edmund!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Waking up)</i> Mmmh! Mother - what do you Want?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Did you want to go to the battle this morning?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund uncovers a sundial by his bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, my God. It's eleven o'clock!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He leaps up. Let's face it, he has overslept on a rather big day.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: A FIELD NEAR BOSWORTH FIELD</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund and Baldrick are galloping along on the horizon.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord, where is the battle, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Somewhere called, oh, Bosworth Field.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They ride off</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The horses neigh. They ride back going the opposite way.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Damn! The first decent battle since I reached puberty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: NEAR THE BROW OF A HILL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund and Baldrick ride on.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Here we are, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Hurray! Onward, Baldrick, to glory!<br />
			<br />
			<i>At the top of the hill the noise of battle suddenly hits them, and Edmund's face goes white at what
			he sees. A real battle.</i><br />
			<br />
			Yes. I'm not so sure we re needed you know, Baldrick. I mean.., everything seems to be going very well,
			doesn't it? Everyone's fighting: clearly having the time of their lives. Some people over there aren't
			fighting. They're just lying down..<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			They're dead, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes. Urn. Damn, I knew I'd forgotten something. Would you excuse me a moment, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: FURTHER ALONG THE BROW OF THE HILL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Out of the view of Edmund and Baldrick, Richard III emerges for a moment from the smoke of battle;
			unhorsed Richard, Duke of York, rides up to greet him. It is a massively hearty scene.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			My lord, you have lost your steed: take mine!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			No, no: I have won the battle, I have saved the kingdom. I think I can find myself a horse!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Most true, most noble lord! I'll see you back at the castle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			So be it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He gathers himself together and strides gleefully on, in the merriest of moods.</i><br />
			<br />
			A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Then he spies Edmund's horse tied up before him. There is a shuffling in the bushes nearby and the
			odd metal limb showing. Edmund is relieving himself.</i><br />
			<br />
			Ah! Horsie.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund emerges in armour from behind a tree just as the king starts to untie the horse.<br />
			<br />
			A neigh alerts Edmund to what's going on. He turns and unsheathes his sword.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oi! That's my horse!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund scuttles over and cuts the king's head off with one simple, short slice.</i><br />
			<br />
			There! That'll teach you. You won't be doing that again now, will you?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He moves confidently and picks up the head. As he picks up the head, the visor snaps open. Richard
			III's face is inside. Edmund snaps the visor down in horror.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, my God: it's Great Uncle Richard.<br />
			Aaaaaaah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What is it, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund throw's him the head.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, my God, it's Richard III. What are you going to do?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The solution strikes Edmund. He takes the head and tries desperately to jam it back onto Richard III ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, obviously ...  Come on, come on!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He manages to balance it for one, hopeful moment.</i><br />
			<br />
			There we go ... Now ... wait!<br />
			<br />
			<i>But it is no good. He and Baldrick take a leg each and start to drag the body off Baldrick has a bright idea.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord! That hut, over there!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They exit, dragging the body.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: A WOODCUTTER'S HUT</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Come on, hurry up - pull. Pull! Come on, Baldrick. Pull your weight.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund and Baldrick enter. Edmund carrying the king's shoes, Baldrick dragging the body by the feet.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Phewww.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A moment's pause.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Where's the head?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I thought you had it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Baldrick, I can't he expected to carry everything.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There are noises outside, Edmund and Baldrick are terrified. Percy enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			Percy, you brainless son of a prostitute. Where've you been?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy is very pleased with himself</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I've just proved that I'm a man. Look what I've found.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He holds up the head.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, thank God. Put it down. Percy, and let's get out of here.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			No, I found it, it's mine!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What do you mean, it's yours?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I'm going to use it as proof that I have killed a nobleman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Which nobleman?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy checks under the visor.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Errmm ... <i>(Proudly)</i> Well, it's the king actually.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Then he realizes that's not a good thing. He throws the helmet with the head in it to Edmund. Edmund
			throws the helmet to Baldrick. Baldrick throws the helmet in a barrel and they all head for the door.
			Baldrick opens it and Henry Tudor falls in. Their vile enemy. Not that they recognize him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Henry VII</b><br />
			Lost. Lost. All is lost.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Henry VII</b><br />
			We must flee; flee!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, my God: quick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Henry VII grabs his leg as Edmund is making for the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Henry VII</b><br />
			Take me with you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Get your hands off!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Henry VII</b><br />
			If you leave me alone here, I will die.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			If you don't leave me alone, I'll kill you myself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Henry VII</b><br />
			I'll give you money!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The door slams. They are gone. He shouts after them ...</i><br />
			<br />
			Ten thousand sovereigns.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy's head appears back round the door. He's interested.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen is standing in an alcove. Edmund and Baldrick run in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Mother!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Edmund dear, how did it go?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick rushes to the arches at the other end of the hall.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Within seconds, Henry Tudor will be here at our gates.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, Edmund, I'm not ready. I haven't had a bath or anything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Mother, Henry is our <i>enemy</i>. When his men get here they'll brutally ravish you and every woman
			in the castle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I shan't bother to change then.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What do you want?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Listen!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They hear the sound, ba-ba-ba-burn baba-ba-bum, of distant drums. Edmund rushes to the window.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, my God, they're here already. Run for your lives! Run for the hills!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, my lord, they are coming from the hills!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund runs ineffectually back and forth.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Run away from the hills! If you see hills, run the other way!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			But they're flying the banners of our King Richard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			That's impossible - he's dead, isn't he!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			King Richard, dead?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund is slightly caught out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ah, yes. God knows how!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, dear. That's really upset the tulip cart.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Those flags are obviously just a cunning trick to deceive us into staying.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			But, hut, but<br />
			<br />
			<i>The tramp of the army is getting closer.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm not so sure it's a cunning trick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, no, it's not a particularly cunning trick because we've seen through it <br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund locks the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			But obviously they thought it was cunning when they thought it up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm not so sure they did think it up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, you think someone else thought it up and they borrowed it for the occasion?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			My lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, I'm not sure it's a trick at all.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I think we should go.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The tramping is now very close.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			You don't think riding up to a castle under someone else's banners is a trick?<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a loud crash on the door.</i> Argh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			It's only your father.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund rushes out and locks the door behind him. Baldrick tries to follow, and hides behind a
			tapestry. Percy dithers around the queen. There is another crash, the door falls down and Richard,
			Duke of York, enters with various lords.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Who locked that bloody door?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, Richard, it's you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Who did you expect it to be, woman?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, I thought it would be Henry Tulip.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Henry Tulip? Have you lost your conkers?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			So you won?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Yes, of course! We won! We won! <i>Victory!</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurrah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			<i>(With a sigh)</i> So, I suppose now you want to ravish me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Yes, yes. In a moment. The woman s insatiable! Three cheers for Good King Richard! Hap hap!<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Huzzah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Hap hap!<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hnzzah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Hap hap!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund has now crept back and joined them having realized his mistake.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Huzzah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			All we need now is King Richard with us here, and the day shall be complete.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes, what a pity he's dead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			What?!<br />
			<br />
			<i>All are horrified.</i><br />
			<br />
			Who told you that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Is this true?<br />
			<br />
			<i>All turn on Edmund, who two seconds ago thought he was so safe. He backs himself along the
			wall.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, well I wouldn't know really. I mean I was nowhere near him at the time. I just heard from
			someone that he'd, er ... I mean I don't know where he was killed. I was completely on the opposite
			side of the field. I was nowhere near the cottage. Not that it was a cottage. It was a river. But
			then I wouldn't know, because I wasn't there. But apparently some fool cut his head off. Or at
			least killed him in some way: perhaps took an ear off. In fact I think he was only wounded. Or was
			that somebody else? Yes, it was: he wasn't even wounded, in fact. Why, did someone say he was dead?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Everyone is still facing him intently, when from behind them comes Prince Harry, carrying Richard
			Ill's body in his weary arms.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			It is true, my lord. I stumbled upon his body myself.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He lays the body on the ground and kneels beside it.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth. Goodnight, sweet king. And flights of angels sing
			thee to thy rest.<br />
			<br />
			<i>This isn't at all to his father's taste.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard, Duke of York</b><br />
			Yes, yes, yes. Very good, Harry. That's enough of that. We all know who did this dreadful deed,
			don't we?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns to Edmund. Edmund nods slowly. He thinks death must be seconds away.</i><br />
			<br />
			Henry Tudor!<br />
			<br />
			Edmund nods vigorously.<br />
			<br />
			Yes, and he still roams free. Harry, call for silence.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Prince Harry gets up, carrying Richard Ill's crown.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Silence!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He places the crown on the head of the new king.</i><br />
			<br />
			Long live the king.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			<i>(Kneeling)</i> Long live King Richard IV!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The new king responds in a manner most somber and Shakespearian.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			This day has been as 'twere a mighty stew, In which the beef of victory was mixed with the vile
			turnip of sweet Richard slain And the gristly dumpling of his killer fled. But we must eat the
			yellow wobbly parts the Good Lord serves In life, each man gets what he deserves.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a moment of philosophical consideration by all.</i><br />
			<br />
			Come on, let's go and kill some more prisoners.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The door opens and Edmund, Percy and Baldrick enter gravely. But then they explode with
			pandemonic joy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			We're safe! And I'm a Prince of the Realm! Hap hap.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Huzzah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Huzzah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Can you imagine the power?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ours, all ours.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yours, all yours<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is cm knock. They dramatically settle into gravity, and Prince Harry enters with a
			ledger under his arm.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Ah, Edmund. I know it's a little early, hut I would just like to get these battle averages sorted
			out. Who did you kill today?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahmmm: no one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			No one. Oh, dear. Right, I'll put you down for a duck, which I'm afraid takes you out of the running
			for the Legion of Honour.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, I see. Sorry: I thought you meant had I killed King Richard?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What.., what was the question?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Who did you kill today?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He is very formal and organized.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, I see, right. Oh, well, let's think: ahm ... well ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick tries to help.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			<i>(Whispers)</i> Peasants.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Pedants ... pleasant pedant ... peasants! Peasants! But they don't really count, do they?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Only in the event of a tie. Nevertheless how many did you kill?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick sticks up four fingers, Percy five fingers to prompt him. Edmund is slightly puzzled.
			</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahm ... four ... four hand... hand ... handred ... hand ... hand ... hand ... fifty. Four hundred
			and fifty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Four hundred and fifty! Good Lord! That's three <i>times</i> as many as myself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, well, I had a couple of lucky breaks.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			And nobles?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund looks at Percy and Baldrick but they are stumped.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahm, well, there was, let's see. I think, Lord Coverdale<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Who fought on our side, I believe.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, I think Lord Coverdale saw me slaying ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick impersonates someone - he tilts his hat and purses his lips.</i><br />
			<br />
			... ahm, Warwick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Warwick the Wild of Leicester?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, that's him. I must say, he was pretty wild too: took some finishing off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Yes, indeed. I killed him myself at one point. Anyone else?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahm. Oh, it's trying to put names to faces, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Here is a list. These lords, I think, are the ones as yet unaccounted for.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund strains forward interestedly.</i><br />
			<br />
			Roger de Runcie.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, yes, right: Roger de Runcie. He was one of mine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Lord Thomas of Devon.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, him too: backslash. <i>(Re-enacting it)</i><br />
			Right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Lord Yeovil.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Getting into his stride)</i> Oh, yes: right. Groin job: yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Well, that's remarkable, Edmund. Oh, and the Bishop of Bath and Wells.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Will never walk again!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			... will conduct the thanksgiving service.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, Bath and Wells!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Ah, Percy! Edmund tells me you managed to turn up to the battle late, so there's no point in asking
			you your score, is there?<br />
			<br />
			<i>And Prince Harry leaves. Percy is Left behind, looking disappointed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ha ha!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick and Percy</b><br />
			Huzzah!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund crosses to the bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			At last I can relax!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He tears open the curtains around his bed: there lies Henry VII, dying.</i><br />
			<br />
			Who the hell is this?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ahm ... you remember that dying man we saw in the cottage..<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			The one I specifically told yon not to bring back to the castle under any circumstances?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Mmmmmm? Yes, that's the one, yes!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			So what is he doing in my bed?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			He claims he is a wealthy man. I thought if we nursed him back to health, he might reward us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Be quiet, Percy. I think I've got an idea. If he is a wealthy man, and we nurse him back to health,
			he may reward us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Brilliant. That was quick thinking, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund and Percy</b><br />
			Thank you, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund glares at Percy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>Yes,</i> well, what would you expect? Who has the fastest brain in the land?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Prince Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Who is the boldest horseman in the land?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			<i>(With Percy joining in)</i> Prince Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Who is the bravest swordsman in the land?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh yes, don't tell me! That's that earl from Norfolk<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund turns round threateningly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Prince<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick and Percy</b><br />
			... Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Precisely. Or, as I shall be known from now on ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>It is a great heroic moment, the birth of a legend ...</i><br />
			<br />
			The Black Vegetable!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns for applause.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Erm. My lord, wouldn't something like the Black Adder sound better?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, wait ... <i>(he steps back)</i> I think I have a better idea. What about <i>(he steps forward)
			</i> the Black Adder?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all cheer. A hero is born.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Three doublets are being held in front of Edmund: one orange, one gaudy green, one black. Edmund
			points at the black one.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			That one!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund, now with the black doublet on, is faced by three pairs of shoes - two different shades of
			brown, one pair black and with very pointed toes. Edmund points at the black pair.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			That one!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWELVE: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund, now in a black cloak and doublet, is faced by three metal pots: one copper, one silver,
			one black iron. Edmund points at the roundish one, the smallest, black one.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			That one!<br />
			<br />
			<i>A few minutes later. The pot is just about to be lifted off Edmund's head, as the final cut is
			made to the hair. The pot is lifted off Edmund stands up. Everything is just right: the hair, the
			black clothes, all the way down to the pointy-toed shoes. He smiles. He is perfection. With a now
			spectacularly daft hairstyle.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THIRTEEN: A CORRIDOR IN THE CASTLE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund, Percy and Baldrick are walking along.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Very witty, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Thank you, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, yes, very, very, very witty, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Thank you, Percy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You're certainly wittier than your father, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy will not be outdone.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			And head and shoulders over Richard III.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund turns in fury.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Is that supposed to he witty?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Scared)</i> No, my lord: just an example of the sort of thing you wouldn't stoop to.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Go away!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They leave and Edmund ducks up to his room.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOURTEEN: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund enters and looks around to check no one is there. He goes to his bed and draws back
			its black curtain. The man who was dressed in armour is sitting there in bed. It is Henry VII.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, you're still here are you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Henry VII</b><br />
			Ak, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Henry is eating soup. Edmund has a vague flash of inspiration. He leans over the bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Wait a moment, haven't I seen you somewhere before?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Henry VII</b><br />
			I don't know. I feel I have seen you before also.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, yes: I'm Prince Edmund, son of Richard IV, in <i>fact.</i> Who are you?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Henry is terrified, as he realizes the deadly danger he's in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Henry VII</b><br />
			I'm ... not important.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Not important? So, you're not rich?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Henry VII</b><br />
			Oh, yes! I'm extremely rich, an incredibly rich, modest person, who wishes to remain nameless.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, you'd better he rich: get better, get your money and get out of my bed! Is that clear?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He reaches for a black parcel on a small table, closing the bed curtains again. He unwraps it,
			to reveal a small princely crown. Edmund is aware of the presumption, so he looks around his room
			again before trying it on in front of the mirror. He is very proud. And very alone. Then suddenly
			he hears a voice.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Oh, yes, very fetching.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund turns and sees Richard III sitting calm and relaxed in the chair behind him. He screams,
			covers his mouth and continues to scream. Suddenly he stops and looks at Richard in wide-eyed terror.</i><br />
			<br />
			And hello to you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Hello! Hello, sorry: it s a ... I didn't expect to see you like this.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			What, sitting down you mean?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes. Yes. Sitting down. Good Lord, there you are, sitting down. Why, I haven't seen you sitting down
			since<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Yesterday.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Was it only yesterday? Yes it was. Good Lord. How was your battle?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Oh, fine, somebody cut my head off at one point, but apart from that it went swimmingly. And how
			are you, Edna?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Oh, your father told me Edna.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			So, Edna, you loathsome little fairy maggot, how are you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			How kind of you to ask, your Majesty. I'm very well. It's very good to see you, because frankly .<br />
			<br />
			<i>He moves over to Richard III, who is still seated.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, well, frankly ... gosh, you look well.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Frankly what? Spit it out, you horrid little scabby reptile.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, frankly, everyone thought you were dead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Well, frankly ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>His head lifts off his shoulders and flies up to Edmund's face.</i><br />
			<br />
			I am!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund screams, at which moment there is a knock on the door. Richard III replies politely</i><br />
			<br />
			Do come in!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, don't come in.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			<i>(From behind the door)</i> Why not? Have you got someone in there with you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahm, not as such.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Is it a woman?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Is it a man?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Richard III's head flies playfully around the room.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahm:	well ... yes, yes, it is.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			You hesitated, Edmund. It's not a sheep, is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No, it certainly isn't a sheep.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well then, let me in.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Richard III's body and head are now together again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			So, farewell, Edna: you'll be seeing me later.<br />
			<br />
			<i>His body and head separate once more and the body walks backwards. Edmund addresses the head.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Have you got transport? If you want to borrow my horse again, or at all ... not that you borrowed
			it before ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Richard ill's body summons his head.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Coming.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He disappears into the cupboard as the queen enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Edmund, are you all right? You look as though you've just seen a ghost.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, hurry up anyway. You're expected at the banquet.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She looks in the cupboard trying to find out what was going on earlier.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, yes, all right. Mother, you won't tell anyone about my oversleeping this morning and what have
			you, will you?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen closes the cupboard.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Would I? Do I tell people that your brother Harry is scared of spoons, or that your father has very
			small private parts?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Ahm, no.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen moves towards the bed. Edmund panics.</i><br />
			<br />
			Mother!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The queen turns to him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Henry VII</b><br />
			<i>(Hidden behind curtain of bed)</i> Baa! Baa!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, Edmund. It's the <i>lying</i> I find so hurtful ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>(Looking sheepish)</i> Baa!<br />

			<b>SCENE FIFTEEN: THE GREAT HALL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A lordly banquet is in progress again. Edmund enters; he is late.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			<i>(Greasily)</i> So sorry I'm late . .<br />
			<br />
			<i>He tries to take the chair next to the king.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Hold! You dare sit there, boy? That was King Richard's seat - would you insult his ghost?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Er. No. No. Sorry.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And suddenly Richard III materializes in the chair. Only Edmund can see him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Yes, find your own chair, you smelly little dog's pizzle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Wha ...!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He backs off hurriedly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			How many prisoners have we got left, Harry?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Richard III starts talking across them, but obviously he can't be heard.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Well I'm not Harry, he's Harry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			About a couple of dozen, my liege.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Well, send a brace up to my room, will you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			Do you want them hung?<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Ngi ngi fredi ones. I must nut in some work on my backhand.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Hello, hello. Anybody there?<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			I wish Uncle Dicky were here.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Don't Dicky me, ducky.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The king bangs the table for silence. Richard  Ill reacts with irritation to the noise.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Tonight, honoured friends, we are gathered to celebrate a great victory and to mourn a great loss.
			A toast to our triumph.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Our triumph.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			And I raise our royal curse upon the man who slew Richard, our noble king.<br />

			<i>Richard III stands and points to Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />

			It was him!<br />

			Oh, my God!<br />

			<b>King</b><br />
			<i>(Annoyed)</i> Silence at the end there.<br />

			Whoever it was ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			It was him ... Edna.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Unfortunately no one except Edmund can hear him.</i><br />

			<b>King</b><br />
			Wherever he be ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			He's down there at the end.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			He shall be struck down.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Then get on with it, you stupid oaf: there he is!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			It wasn't me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Who said that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			The idiot who killed me this afternoon.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			I didn't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Well then, who did?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Prince Harry</b><br />
			It <i>was</i> actually Edmund who interrupted, sire.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Hang the little slug.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No! No! No!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He climbs under the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			I will have silence! Come, dear friends, another toast to dead King Richard!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			<i>(Bored)</i> Oh, my God!<br />

			Gentlemen!<br />

			<b>King and Lords</b><br />
			Richard!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			So, thanks for nothing. Thanks a lot. Thank you very much indeed. That's the last you'll he seeing
			of me, not that you've seen anything anyway.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Richard disappears and Edmund peeks out from under the table. He is soaked in sweat and very
			relieved.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>King</b><br />
			Now we have silence, we shall continue with the ceremony of desecration. Produce the portrait of
			the Pretender, Henry Tudor.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The portrait is brought in at floor level and is just about to be held up. Edmund, who is still
			under the table, sees it. He has an immediate flashback of Henry Tudor in his bed, eating soup.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Oh, my God!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He crawls out from under the table and across the floor to the door. Percy and Baldrick look
			bemused at his behaviour.</i><br />

			<b>SCENE SIXTEEN: EDMUND'S TOWER ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Dead, ghostly Richard opens the door, and Edmund bursts in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Richard III</b><br />
			Good evening.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Where's Henry Tudor?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He crosses to the bed and throws open the curtains. Richard III is lying in the bed making
			baaing noises.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, no!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund crosses to the cupboard and opens it. Richard III is inside making ghostly noises.</i><br />
			<br />
			Where is he? Where is he?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund dashes to the window in a panic ... in time to see Henry VII riding off outside. He
			runs to the door. Richard III opens it for him.</i><br />
			<br />
			Er, thank you so much.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He runs out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVENTEEN: THE WOODS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund rides off in hot pursuit of Henry. He reaches some woods and comes across three witches,
			Cordelia, Goneril and Regan, wailing over afire. He coughs self-consciously and they all jump.</i><br />

			<i>This particularly worries Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Begone, hideous crones!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cordelia</b><br />
			Be not amazed!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Goneril</b><br />
			Be not overcome with fear!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Regan</b><br />
			Be not paralysed with terror!<br />
			<br />
			<i>This is a little strange, since they are a foot shorter than him. And he's not even slightly nervous.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Why have you lured me here, loathsome drabs?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Regan</b><br />
			We bear good news!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			What news could such repulsive harbingers convey?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Goneril</b><br />
			Today has brought misfortune.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cordelia</b><br />
			But one day ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Oh, glorious day!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Goneril</b><br />
			One day ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Oh, happy day!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			<i>You shall be king!</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Yes, your Majesty ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>They bow low.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Well, that <i>is</i> good news! God be with you, you snuggle-toothed vultures! History, here I come!<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he mounts his horse and rides off to glory.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHTEEN: THE WOODS AGAIN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A few hours later. The three old crones are sitting round discussing Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Cordelia</b><br />
			He wasn't as I expected.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Regan</b><br />
			I thought he was <i>very rude.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Cordelia</b><br />
			I thought Henry Tudor would he better looking.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Goneril</b><br />
			Yes, and not so Jewish.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Regan</b><br />
			More like that man who rode by just before.<br />
			<br />
			<i>All three of them realize their mistake simultaneously and hit their foreheads in one motion.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Oh, no!
