			<b>SCENE ONE: A ROOM IN A ONE ROOM COUNTRY COTTAGE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Kate is sitting with her father. She is young and pretty, and he is old and gibbering.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Father, I must speak. I can be silent no longer. All day long you mutter to yourself, gibber,
			dribble, moan and bash your head against the wall yelling, 'I want to die'. Now, you may say I'm
			leaping to conclusions, but you're not completely happy, are you? It's mother, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Father</b><br />
			No, it's not.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			You're brooding over her death, aren't you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Father</b><br />
			Kate, for the final time, your mother is not dead. She's run off with your Uncle Henry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Dear Father, I know you only say such things to comfort me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Father</b><br />
			Your mother is alive and well and living in Droitwich. It's not her I brood over. I'm sad because,
			my darling, our poverty has now reached such extremes that I can no longer afford to keep us and
			must look to my own dear tiny darling to sustain me in my frail dotage.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			But Father, surely ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Father</b><br />
			Yes, Kate ... I want you to become a prostitute.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Never, Father.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Father</b><br />
			Do you defy me?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Indeed I do, for 'tis better to die poor than to live in shame and ignominy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Father</b><br />
			No, it isn't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			I'm young and strong, clever, my nose is pretty. I shall find another way to earn us a living.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Father</b><br />
			Oh, please go on the game. It's a steady job and you'd be working from home.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Goodbye, Father. I shall go to London, disguise myself as a boy, and seek my fortune.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Father</b><br />
			Why walk all the way to London when you can make a fortune lying on your back?<br />
			<br />
			<i>But Kate has gone for ever.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Lord Edmund Blackadder is a noble of modest means. When not attending to the needs of his queen,
			he inhabits lodgings in Drury Lane, not very spacious, not very light, but with lots of nice exposed
			beams.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is taking aim with a bow and arrow. Baldrick is at the door, holding a target above
			his head. Blackadder shoots a bullseye.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Very good shot, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The door against which Baldrick is standing suddenly swings open. It is Percy. He carries a bow,
			and wears a distinctly Robin Hoody hat. Baldrick, still holding the target, is, in fact, pinned to
			the door. He moves with it as it opens.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Sorry I'm late.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't bother apologizing. I'm sorry you're alive.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ah, good, I see the target's ready.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He lines up his bow professionally for a shot.</i><br />
			<br />
			I'd like to see the Spaniard who could make his way past me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Then go to Spain, there are millions of them.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy lines up, and then turns again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I advise them to stay there then - keep their hands off our women.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God, who is she this time?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I don't know what you mean.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy turns to take his shot again and Blackadder removes a pink envelope from his pocket.
			Percy lunges to grab it, but Blackadder, without looking up from the letter, stops him clean
			with a kick in the nether regions.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And who is Jane?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I am sworn to secrecy. Torture me, kill me, you shall never know!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Another casual but deadly blow from Blackadder to Percy's soft bits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>(In great pain)</i> Jane Harrington!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			We are very much in love, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			This is <i>the</i> Jane Harrington?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Proud)</i> Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Jane 'bury me in a Y-shaped coffin' Harrington?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I think maybe there are two Jane Harringtons.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No. Tall, blonde, elegant?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, that's right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Goes like a privy door when the plague's in town?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			My lord!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Come on, get on with your shot, you'll get over her ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy tries to forget it and concentrate on a shot.</i><br />
			<br />
			I did. <i>(Percy struggles to control himself)</i> So did Baldrick actually.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick smiles in happy memory. Percy is for a moment incensed. He drops his aim and shoots
			Baldrick in the codpiece. Baldrick looks down at the arrow sticking in his codpiece.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Ow!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Damn!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You see, she's got a thing about beards, apparently.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, in that case, I'm going to shave. <br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy leaves, opening the door by using the arrow in Baldrick 's codpiece. The door swings shut
			with Baldrick still on it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Bad luck, Balders.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Not to worry, my lord. The arrow didn't, in fact, enter my body.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No. By a thousand to one chance, my willy got in the way.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Extraordinary.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, sir. I'd only just put it there, but now I will leave it there for ever.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Quite so, Baldrick. It can be your lucky willy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, my lord. Years from now, I shall show it to my grandchildren.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Baldrick, I think that grandchildren may now be out of the question.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder pulls the arrow out of the codpiece, thereby releasing Baldrick from the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			Poor old peabrain Percy. Never catch me falling in love, that's for damn sure as mustard.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a knock at the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			Come in.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick opens the door and Kate enters, now dressed, in classic Shakespearian style, as a girl
			pretending to be a boy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Good day to you, Lord Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder chokes up for a moment: a flash of romantic music; it's jolly nearly love at first
			sight. But he recovers; after all, this is a boy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good day to you, boy. What is it brings you here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			I'm an honest, hard-working lad, but poor, and I must support my father, who is stark-raving mad.
			Therefore I have come to London to seek a servant's wage.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, yes, indeed. Unfortunately, I already have a servant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			The word is that your servant is the worst servant in London.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mmmmm. That's true. Baldrick, you're fired. Be out of the house in ten minutes. Well, young man ...
			you've got yourself a job. What do they call you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Kate.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Not thinking, she is as much taken with Blackadder as he is with her.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Isn't that a bit of a ... girl's name?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			It's uhm, short for, uhm, Bob.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Bob?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, Bob, welcome on board.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They shake hands in a magical moment. Blackadder notices that Baldrick hasn't moved.</i><br />
			<br />
			Sorry, Baldrick. Any reason you're still here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I've got nowhere to go, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Kate release hands. Blackadder puts his arm around Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, surely you'll be allowed to starve to death in one of the royal parks?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I've been in your service since I was two and a half, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, that must be why I'm so utterly sick of the sight of you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Couldn't I just stay here and do the same jobs but for no wages?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder removes his arm.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, you know where you'd have to live ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			In the gutter?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, and you'd have to work a bit harder too.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Of course, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right. Go and get Bob's stuff in then and chuck your filthy muck out into the street.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick smiles.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			God bless you, sweet master.<br />
			<br />
			<i>As Baldrick opens the door to leave, Percy enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now, Bob, this is Percy: a smooth-shaving dimwit I don't seem to be able to shake off.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy strides forward in a hearty manner which he imagines makes young lads admire and look up
			to him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Hullo there, young Bob, you young roister-doister you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He tousles her hair, to Kate's alarm.</i><br />
			<br />
			You look a likely sort of lad, for tricks and sports and all sorts of jolly, rosy-cheeked caperings,
			eh? Course you do, and more besides, I'll warrant, you young scamp! Ha ha ha.<br />
			<br />
			<i>But Kate has eyes only for Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Thank you so much for letting me stay, Lord Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, not at all, Bob. I'm looking forward to having you ... <i>(he panics at the double entendre)</i>
			having ... another man about the house, instead of that animal Baldrick. Excuse me. I'm just going
			to the lavatory.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder exits, worried.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			How little he knows! And how much I would have him know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I say, Bob, I think this calls for a celebration. How about a game of cup and ball and a slap-up tea
			at Mrs Miggins's Pie Shop?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Get lost, creep.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I like you, young Bob. You've got balls!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			Q<i>ueenie, her advisor, Melchett, and her nurse, Nursie, are in her private chamber. It is not a huge
			room, but it is highly ornate, with enough gilt to gild a huge field of very large lilies.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie is utterly bored, her arms slung back over her throne. Before her, Melchett is doing some
			kind of hornpipe dance, like a sailor out at sea.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Nice try, Melchy, but it's no use. I'm still bored.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett stops.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I'm very sorry, madam. Your royal father used to be very amused by my impersonation of Columbus.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Doesn't surprise me. He used to laugh at those people with the funny faces, and the bells.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Ah - jesters, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			No. <i>(Tiny pause to remember)</i> Lepers. Where's Edmund these days?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, the whisper on the underground grapevine, ma'am, is that Lord Blackadder is spending all his
			time with a young boy in his service.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh. Do you think he'd spend more time with me if I was a boy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Surely not, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			You almost were a boy, my little cherry pip.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Yeah. Out you popped from your mummy's tumkin and everyone shouted, 'It's a boy! It's a boy!' And
			then someone said, 'But it hasn't got a winkle!' And then I said, 'A boy without a winkle! God be
			praised - it's a miracle! A boy without a winkle!' And then Sir Thomas More pointed out that a boy
			without a winkle is a girl, and everyone was really disappointed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, well, you see he was a very perceptive man, Sir Thomas More.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, what has happened to Edmund? There's something very odd about someone who spends all their time
			with a servant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: THE COUNTRYSIDE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>These are indeed happy times for Blackadder and 'Bob'. They walk along a beach together laughing.
			They are in a wood, it begins to rain and, laughing, they run for shelter. They laze in the sun on a
			grassy knoll. It is sunset; they stroll together.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>In the background, music plays, reminiscent of some great Elizabethan love songs:</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Greensleeves; The Rain It Raineth Every Day; Hey, Nonny I Love You; My Love is a Prick (on a Tudor
			Rose); Hot Sex Madrigal in the Middle of My Tights</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is late at night. Blackadder is seated on a chair and Kate is pouring him a drink.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, Bob, we're a couple of fine lads together, aren't we? Let's get ratted and talk about girls.
			<i>(He slaps his thigh with false bravado)</i> Yes, we could sing some really dirty songs and ...
			<i>(He can't help but look at her, but he tries to carry on being masculine)</i> Oh, God ... I find
			you curiously pleasant company, young Bob.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			I am honoured, and for my part want nothing more than to be with you ... old man.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, yes, of course, there's nothing more healthy and ... normal ... than having a good ... chum.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			What think you, my lord, of ... love?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You mean rumpy-pumpy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			What would you say, my lord, if I were to say I love you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, of course, it would depend entirely on who you said it to. If you said it to a horse, I'd presume
			you were sick, if you said it to Baldrick, I'd presume you were blind, and if you said it to me ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Yes, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I'd naturally assume we were having a big lads' joke about backticklers, the way we healthy
			fellows often do, and so I'd probably grab you for a friendly wrestle and we'd probably slap each
			other's thighs like jolly good chums, and laugh at what it would be like ... if we really did ...
			fancy each other.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			In that case, my lord, I love you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder laughs unconvincingly. He jumps up and they grab each other. There is a half-hearted
			effort at wrestling, which ends with Blackadder sitting on Kate's stomach. Then a pause, and they
			move together as if about to kiss when Baldrick enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick </b><br />
			<i>(Misunderstanding)</i> Don't worry, Bob. He used to try and kill me, too.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder jumps up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, Baldrick. God, am I glad to see you. What do you want?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I was just wondering if I could sleep on the roof. The Town Bailiff says if I lie in the gutter,
			I'll be flushed into the Thames with all the other turds.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			By all means, Baldrick, help yourself. I was just off to bed anyway ... erm, goodnight, Baldrick,
			goodnight ... Bob.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Goodnight, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. Oh, God!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Edmund exits, in despair.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: DOCTOR LEECH'S SURGERY</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Dr Leech is keen on leeches. There are large pictures of leeches on the wall and jars of leeches
			everywhere, and a blackboard with a leech drawn on it, with a little leech on its back. Dr Leech
			sits behind the desk, with Blackadder on the other side.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			Now then, what seems to be the trouble?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, it's my manservant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			I see. Well, don't be embarrassed. If you've got the pox, just pop your manservant on the table and
			we'll take a look at it, shall we?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, it's my real manservant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			And what's wrong with him?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Nothing is wrong with him. That's the problem. He's perfect. And last night I almost kissed him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			I see. So, you've started fancying boys then, have you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not 'boys'. A boy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			Yes, well, let's not split hairs, it's all rather disgusting, and naturally you're worried.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course I'm worried.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			Well, of course you are. It's not every day a man wakes up to discover he's a screaming bender with
			no more right to live on God's clean earth than a weasel. Ashamed of yourself?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not really, no.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Dr Leech goes to wash his hands.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			Bloody hell, I would be, still why should I complain, just leaves more rampant totty for us real men,
			eh?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Am I actually paying for this personal abuse, or is it extra?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			No, all part of the service. Mmmm, I think you re in luck, though. An extraordinary new cure has just
			been developed for exactly this kind of sordid problem.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It wouldn't have anything to do with leeches, would it?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Dr Leech double-takes.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			I had no idea you were a medical man.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, no. Just I've never had anything you doctors didn't try to cure with leeches. Leech on my ear for
			earache. Leech up my bottom for constipation.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			They're marvellous, aren't they?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, the bottom one wasn't. I sat down and squashed it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			You know, the leech comes to us on the highest authority.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. I'd heard that. Dr Hoffman of Stuttgart, wasn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			That's right. The great Hoffman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Owner of the largest leech farm in Europe.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			Yes. I can't spend all day gossiping. I'm a busy man.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Dr Leech goes to the desk, followed by Blackadder. They both sit.</i><br />
			<br />
			As far as this case is concerned, I've had time to think it through and I can strongly recommend a
			course of.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech and Blackadder</b><br />
			 ... leeches.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, just pop a couple down my codpiece before I go to bed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't be ridiculous. This isn't the Dark Ages. No - just pop four in your mouth
			in the morning, and let them dissolve slowly.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Dr Leech hands Blackadder a prescription.</i><br />
			<br />
			Within a couple of weeks, you'll be beating your servant with a stick just like the rest of us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You're really just an old quack, aren't you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Dr Leech</b><br />
			I'd rather he a quack than a ducky. Good day.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Breakfast. Blackadder is sitting at the table. Baldrick enters, with a plate and a spider.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Anything to follow, my lord? There's this lovely fat spider I found in the bath. I was saving it for
			myself, but ... if you fancy it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Shut up, Baldrick. I don't eat invertebrates for fun, you know. This is doctor's orders.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick eats the spider.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I don't hold with all this newfangled doctoring. Any problems, I go to the wisewoman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Baldrick, I'm long past entrusting myself to some deranged Druid who gives her professional
			address as 1 Dunghull Mansions, Putney.<br />
			<br />
			<i>So he thinks.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: OUTSIDE THE HOVEL </b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The sign reads '1 Dunghill Mansions'. It is very dark and gungy. Blackadder walks up the path to

			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Tell me, young crone, is this Putney?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Young Crone</b><br />
			That it be, that it be!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			'Yes, it is', not 'That it be'. You don't have to talk in that stupid voice to me. I'm not a tourist.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Young Crone</b><br />
			<i>(Slightly deflated)</i> Oh.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I seek information about a wisewoman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Young Crone</b><br />
			Ah! The wisewoman! The wisewoman!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, the wisewoman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Young Crone</b><br />
			Two things, my lord, must ye know of the wisewoman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Young Crone</b><br />
			First! She is a woman. And second, she is ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Wise?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Young Crone</b><br />
			You do know her then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, no, just a wild stab in the dark, which is incidentally what you'll be getting if you don't
			start being a bit more helpful. Do you know where she lives?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Young Crone</b><br />
			'Course.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Where?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Young Crone</b><br />
			Here. Do you have an appointment?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Young Crone</b><br />
			Well, you can go in anyway.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you, young crone. Here is a purse of moneys ... which I'm not going to give to you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters the hovel.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: THE HOVEL</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>There stands the Wisewoman, in full wise-woman regalia.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wisewoman</b><br />
			Hail, Edmund, Lord of Adders Black.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Hullo.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wisewoman</b><br />
			Step no nearer. For already I see thy bloody purpose. Thou plottest, Blackadder! Thou would'st be
			king and drown Middlesex in a butt of wine.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She cackles.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, no, no, no. It's far worse than that. I'm in love with my manservant.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Wisewoman gets on to the bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Wisewoman</b><br />
			Oh, well, I'd sleep with him, if I were you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wisewoman</b><br />
			When I fancy people, I sleep with them. I have to drug them first, of course, being so old and warty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But what about my position, my social life?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wisewoman</b><br />
			Very well then. Three other paths are open to you, three cunning plans to cure thy ailment.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wisewoman</b><br />
			The first is simple. Kill Bob.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Never.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wisewoman</b><br />
			Then try the second. Kill yourself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And the third?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wisewoman</b><br />
			The third is to ensure that no one else ever knows.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That sounds more like it. How?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Wisewoman</b><br />
			Kill everybody in the whole world.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She cackles.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah ha.<br />
			<br />
			<i>It s clear now. She's quite mad. He gets up and Leaves.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is at the door. He steels himself, enters and finds himself absolutely face to face
			with a bottom. Kate is cleaning some shelves just above the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now ... look here, Bob. I have something to say to you. And I want you to listen very carefully.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Look, Bob. I have decided ... that you are to leave my service.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Oh, no, my lord. My father will starve and I'll have to become a ... male prostitute and besides ...
			I thought we were ... friends.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We are friends, Bob. Of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course,
			of course, of course. In fact, that's the reason I want you to leave my service and become my, live
			in chum.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Oh, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now, I want to make it quite clear that I am in no way interested in the contents of your tights.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			You might be, my lord, if you knew what I kept in them.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I flatter myself, Bob, that I know what a gentleman keeps in his tights, thank you very much.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			But, my lord, I have a great secret.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Prepare to be amazed.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She starts to take her top off.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, no. You haven't got one of those awful birthmarks shaped like a banana, have you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			No!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Or a tattoo saying, 'Get it Here'?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			No!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God, you've got one of those belly buttons that sticks outwards, haven't you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			No, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, what can it possibly be?<br />
			<br />
			<i>She rips open her bodice.</i><br />
			<br />

			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, what was all that Bob stuff about then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Because you would have just used me and cast me aside like you have so many women before.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Would I?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Yes, but now you have had a chance to grow to love me for what I really am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, that's true. And now ... I want to marry you ... Bob.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Kate!<br />

			<b>SCENE TWELVE: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett enters to a very bored Queenie sitting with Nursie.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Madam, I bring grave intelligence of your former favourite, Lord Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			It appears he wishes to marry a girl called Bob.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			That's a very odd name for a girl, isn't it? Girls are normally called Elizabeth, or Mary.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie </b><br />
			And Donald.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Mouth is open, Nursie: should be shut.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			But it's true, sweet one. I had three sisters, and they were called Donald, Eric and Basil.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Then why's your name Nursie?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			That isn't my real name!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			What is your real name then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Bernard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Mmmm. It suits you, actually.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder sweeps in.</i><br />

			Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, bulb, stranger.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder kneels.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I seek your permission to wed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			So I hear - Melchy, what do you think of all this?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I must profess, madam, I am astonished that Blackadder could possibly have eyes for any other woman
			than yourself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Good point, though slightly grovelly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But when I fell in love, ma'am, I didn't know she was a woman. I thought she was a boy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Of course, that makes it perfectly acceptable.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, all right, go on and marry her.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Just tell me one thing. Is her nose as pretty as mine?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, no, no, no, no, no, ma am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, good. Because otherwise I would have cut it off and then you'd have had to marry someone without
			a nose, and that wouldn't be very nice, would it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, ma am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I mean, imagine the mess when she got a cold. Yuk.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, quite, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			All right - off you go then.<br />
			<br />

			<i>Very weddingly, Baldrick is fitted into a lovely dress. Kate is fluffing round with the final

			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			You'll make a lovely bridesmaid, Baldrick, and pity me that I have no actual girl chums because we
			were so poor in our house, we couldn't afford friends.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It is strangely in keeping with the manner of our courtship that your maid of honour should be a man.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Thank you very much, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I use the word 'man' in its broadest possible sense. For as we all know, God made man in his own
			image, and it would be a sad look out for Christians throughout the globe if God looked anything like
			you, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Kate</b><br />
			Ignore Mr Grumpy. There we go, Balders.<br />
			<br />
			<i>(Standing back and admiring)</i><br />
			<br />
			You look sweet as a little pie.<br />

			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Edmund, I ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He stops and spies Baldrick, but does not recognize him and, believing himself to be in the

			<br />
			Oh, hullo there. Edmund you didn't tell me we were expecting guests. And such a pretty one, too.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, you're a little cutie to be hiding yourself away all these years. Tell me, gorgeous, what's
			your name?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			He's called Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Baldrick, that's a pretty name. Edmund used to have a servant called Baldrick, but anyway, away
			with such small talk, lady, a kiss!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			And so modest too, come on, you little tease, you know you want to. Give us a kiss.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			All right, if you say so.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick kisses Percy passionately. Percy claps a hanky to his nose in disgust.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oooo dear, what an original perfume.<br />

			Percy, that <i>is</i> our Baldrick, he's wearing a dress.<br />

			Anyway, what do you want?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy having finally cleaned his lips with a rabbit's-foot-on-a-stick, preens himself for this

			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, erm, Edmund, there has been some discussion around the Court on the subject of who's going
			to be your best man, and I thought it might be the moment to bring it to a conclusion.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, yes, Percy, I would like you ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Overcome)</i> Oh, Edmund, I'm so proud ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Please let me finish. I would like you ... to take this letter to Dover, where is lately docked

			<br />
			<i>Percy knows that he is outclassed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Depressed)</i> Lord Flashheart, the best sword, the best shot, the best sailor, and the best

			<br />

			Even he. To Dover at once!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes. Actually, I was going to suggest Lord Flashheart for best man myself.<br />

			Edmund, how could you? He is my father, my only living relative.<br />

			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			(Hurt, but recovering fast) Well, one name does spring to mind.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, but I can't ask Baldrick. He's a bridesmaid and, besides, I need a friend, an equal, an old
			and trusty companion.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I think there is one person in the room who fits the description.<br />

			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course. Nursie, how do you fancy putting on a pair of hose and being my best man?<br />

			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Edmund! Don't be so naughty. You know perfectly well who Percy's referring to.<br />

			But I can't run in this frock. You see, I've found I actually prefer wearing boys' clothes.<br />
			<br />

			Weird. I always feel more comfy in a dress! I've got a plan, and it's as hot as my pants!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is meanwhile talking to Percy.</i><br />

			What a man Flash is. Things will certainly liven up round here now he's back, won't they, Flash?<br />

			<i>And in a flash they are gloriously gone. Smoke settles on the amazed assembly, then Melchett
