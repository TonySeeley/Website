			<b>SCENE ONE: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Breakfast time at Lord Blackadder's place. Percy and Blackadder are eating the Elizabethan
			equivalent of toast.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I must say, Edmund, it was jolly nice of you to ask me to share your breakfast before the rigours
			of the day begin.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It is said, Percy. that civilized man seeks out good and intelligent company so that through
			learned discourse he may rise above the savage and closer to God.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Delighted)</i> Yes, I'd heard that.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Personally, however, I like to start the day with a total dickhead to remind me I'm best.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder rises and goes to sort out the mail.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Laughing)</i> Beshrew me, Edmund, you in good fooling this morning!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't say 'beshrew me', Percy. Only stupid actors say 'beshrew me'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, how I would love to be an actor. I ha a great talent for it in my youth - I was the man of
			a thousand faces.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			How did you come to choose the ugly mug you've got now, then?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy laughs.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, tush, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And don't say 'tush' either. It's only a short step from 'tush' to 'hey nonny nonny' and then
			I'm afraid I shall have to call the police.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He at last gets round to reading his letter. Immediately, his face lightens.</i><br />
			<br />
			Well, God pats me on the head and says, 'Good boy, Edmund.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			My lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My aunt and uncle, Lord and Lady Whiteadder, the two most fanatical puritans in England, have
			invited themselves to dinner here, tonight.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			But aren't they the most frightful bores?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, but they have one great redeeming feature: their wallets. More capacious than an elephant's
			scrotum and just as difficult to get your hands on. At least until now. For tonight they wish to
			'discuss my inheritance'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Hey nonny nonny, my lord - good news!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>Baldrick!</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters with a piece of cheese hanging from his nose on a string.</i><br />
			<br />
			Why have you got a piece of cheese tied to the end of your nose?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			To catch mice, my lord. I lie on the floor with my mouth open and hope they scurry in.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And do they?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Not yet, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm not surprised. Your breath comes straight from Satan's bottom, Baldrick. The only sort of
			mouse you're going to catch is one without a nose.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That's a pity because the nose is the best bit on a mouse.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Any bit of a mouse will seem like luxury compared to what Percy and I must eat tonight. We are
			entertaining puritan vegetable folk, Balders, and that means no meat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			In that case, I shall prepare my turnip surprise.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And the surprise is?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			There's nothing else in it except the turnip.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So another word for turnip surprise would be a turnip.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A knock on the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			Get the door, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick obeys and exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, my lord, if things go as planned tonight, it would seem congratulations are in order.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Nice try, Percy, but forget it: you're not getting a penny.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a loud crash and Baldrick enters, carrying the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			Baldrick, I would advise you to make the explanation you are about to give phenomenally good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You said, 'Get the door.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not good enough. You're fired.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But, my lord, I've been in your family since 1532.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So has syphilis. Now get out.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Very well, my lord. Oh, by the way, there was a messenger outside when I got the door. Says the
			queen wants to see you. Lord Melchett is very sick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(Grinning)</i> Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes. He's at death's door.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, my faithful old reinstated family retainer, let's go and open it for him then!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: MELCHETT'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett is pale and groaning. Nursie and Queenie are by his bedside when Blackadder enters.
			Queenie leads him to the bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, Edmund, quick, quick! Melchett's dying. We must <i>do</i> something.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, of course: some sort of celebration. But let's wait till he's actually snuffed it. shall we?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Nursie's old methods don't seem to be working.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			<i>(Rubbing his stomach)</i> Come on, little tummy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett groans.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			It all started last night at about two o'clock. I was tucked into bed, having this absolutely
			scrummy dream about ponies when I was awakened by a terrific banging from Lord Melchett.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I never knew he had it in him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			It's true, I promise. He was banging on the castle gates and falling over and singing strange song
			about a girl who possessed something called a dickie die doe?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, it's a lovely old hymn, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder crosses to Melchett. Melchett groans again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, ma'am, I think I know what's wrong with Lord Melchett, and unfortunately, it isn't fatal.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, hurry up and cure the horrible man. I'm fed up with him lying there moaning and groaning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			And letting off such great and fruitsome flappy woof-woofs one can scarcely believe one's tiny
			noseling.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The truth is, Lord Melchett just can't take his ale.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett rises, rallying under these insults.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Madam, I protest! I may be a little delicate this morning but what I drank last night would have
			floored a rhinoceros!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			If it was allergic to lemonade.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			It's Blackadder here who can't take his ale. He's famous for it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yeah?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yeah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yeah?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yeah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, Nursie, isn't it exciting, the boys are getting tough!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I'm sure we all remember the shame and embarrassment of the visit of the King of Austria when
			Blackadder was found wandering naked among the corridors of Hampton Court singing 'I'm Merlin,
			the Happy Pig'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What did you have last night then? A whole half-pint of potato juice?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			On the contrary, I had two flagons of claret and a double helping of curried turtle. I can assure
			you it's no holds barred with us at the annual Communion wine tasting.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Annual - ha! For me and the wild boys, every night is drinky night!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Says who?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Says me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Says you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yeah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yeah?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yeah. You want to come round sometime, have a look at the underside of <i>my</i> table.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			<i>(Loud and firm)</i> Tonight!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			<i>(Still so hung over)</i> Tonight?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(Loving it)</i> Yeah, come on Melchy, what are you scared of?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Perhaps you're right, perhaps he's a wet and a weed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Oh all right then. Tonight. I'll be there.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Hurray: and last one under the table gets 10,000 florins from the loser.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is shocked, but gathers himself ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ma'am? Right. Well, I'll get the beer in then. Right.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder sweeps out of the room.</i> Q<i>ueenie beckons Nursie to the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Nursie, do you know what I'm going to do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I'm going to go along and find out exactly what happens at these 'boys' nights'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Good idea, poppet.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			And I'll wear a cloak with a cowl so no one will recognize me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Another good idea. You're so clever today, you better be careful your foot doesn't fall off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Does that happen when you have lots of brilliant ideas - your foot falls off?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Certainly does. My brother, he had this brilliant idea of cutting his toenails with a scythe and
			<i>his</i> foot fell off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy is sitting at the table, thinking hard with a pen in his hand. Blackadder is pacing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right. Now, the sort of person we're looking for is an aggressive drunken lout with the intelligence
			of a four-year-old and the sexual sophistication of a donkey.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Cardinal Wolsey.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters with a mouse tied to his nose.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder looks hard at him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Why?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I got fed up with an all-mouse diet, my lord. I thought I'd try a cat for variety.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good, well done. And now, returning to the real world, do you have a knife?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yeah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good, because I wish to quickly send off some party invitations, and to make then look particularly
			tough, I wish to write them in blood. Your blood, to be precise.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick produces a knife with some apprehension.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			How much blood will you actually be requiring, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, nothing much, just a small puddle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Will you be wanting me to cut anything off; an arm, or a leg, for instance?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, good lord, no, a little prick should do.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Very well, my lord. I am your bondsman, and must obey.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He scrunches his eyes, about to do the job. Blackadder turns and sees Baldrick just about to
			perform the cruellest cut of all.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, for God's sake, Baldrick! I meant a little prick on the finger.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I haven't got one there!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh. forget it, forget it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Thank you, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick leaves, relieved and still, technically speaking, a man.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right. Now, Perce, how's this list going?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Very well indeed. I thought we could invite my girlfriend Gwendolen.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sorry, no chicks. Who else?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			That's about as far as I'd got, actually.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right. I'll dictate. First, Simon Partridge.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Not Farters Parters, also known as Mr Ostrich?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Even he.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			But he's a fearful oik.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Takes one to know one, Perce. Secondly, Sir Geoffrey Piddle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Not 'Here's to the health of Cardinal Chunder' Piddle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The very same. And thirdly, Freddie Frobisher, the flatulent hermit of Lindisfarne.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Holding his nose)</i> Oh, pong pong!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right. That should do the trick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, and of course, Lord and Lady Whiteadder, who will be coming anyway.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh yes ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Suddenly, Blackadder realizes the dreadful contradiction the evening ahead holds.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, no.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie and Nursie, are back in their usual positions. Blackadder is kneeling before them.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I must say, Edmund: it does look a teeny bit like trying to get out of it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Quite the wrong impression, ma'am. I just want to make it another night. That's all.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Certainly not.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie is surprised at this firm assertion by Nursie.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I beg your pardon?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Well, it's just one excuse after another, isn't it? Next thing he'll be trying to get out of having
			his bath altogether.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			He isn't talking about baths, Nursie.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Well, he should be. How else is he going to keep clean? Soon he'll be saying he doesn't want to
			have his nappy changed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Lord Blackadder doesn't wear a nappy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			In that case, it's even more important that he has a bath.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Shut up, Nursie! I know why you want to get out of it, because I remember the last time you had a
			party, I found you face down in a puddle wearing a pointy hat and singing a song about goblins.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder rises, really quite angry now.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, all right, all right. Tonight it is.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, Edmund, I do love it when you get cross. Sometimes I think about having you executed just to
			see the expression on your face.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: BALDRICK'S ROOM/THE CORRIDOR/BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is waiting for the guests to arrive, and giving the boys their final briefing.
			They enter Baldrick's room to the right of the front door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right - now let's make sure you've got this. We are having two parties here tonight.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy and Baldrick</b><br />
			Right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And they must be kept completely separate.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy and Baldrick</b><br />
			Right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Firstly, a total piss-up involving beer-throwing, broken furniture and wall-to-wall vomiting,
			to be held here in Baldrick's bedroom.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Thank you very much, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder then heads out and on into his lodgings at the end of the corridor Percy and
			Baldrick follow.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And secondly, Percy will join me in here for the gourmet turnip evening. Is the turnip surprise
			ready?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick and Percy start to giggle sheepishly. Percy snorts.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Then what is so funny?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, my lord, when Baldrick and I were preparing the turnip surprise, we had a surprise, for
			we came across a turnip that was exactly the same shape ... as ... a thingy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He and Baldrick lose the battle against giggle hysteria. They both snort with laughter at
			the hilarious memory. Blackadder is not convinced.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A thingy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes. A great, big thingy. It was terrific.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Size is no guarantee of quality, Baldrick. Most horses are very well endowed, but that does not
			necessarily make them sensitive lovers. I trust you have removed this hilarious item?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good. Because there's nothing more likely to stop an inheritance than a thingy shaped turnip.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, absolutely, Edmund. But it was jolly funny.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He and Baldrick start to giggle again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I found it particularly ironic, my lord, because I've got a thingy that's shaped like a turnip.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Yes, all r ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm a big hit at parties.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Are you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes. I hide in the vegetable rack and frighten the children.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What fun. Perhaps you've forgotten that I'm meant to be having a drinking competition here tonight
			with Lord Melchett and 10,000 florins are at stake.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh dear.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What do you mean?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, firstly you haven't got 10,000 florins and thirdly, one drop of the ale and you fall flat
			on your face and start singing that song about the goblin.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's nonsense. But just in case it's true ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It is true, actually.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, all right, it's true, it's true. So the plan is, when I call for my incredibly strong ale,
			you must pass me water in an ale bottle. Have you got that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes ... When you call for ale, I pass water.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good. And Percy, your job is to stay here and suck up to my aunt.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I think you can trust me to know how to handle a woman.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a knock on the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			Right, here goes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder rushes into the corridor, followed by Baldrick, who brushes him down with a clothes
			brush, which he then throws into the cupboard. Percy stands at the entrance to Blackadder's
			lodgings.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder opens the front door, and there are the Whiteadders: crosses on hats, shoulders and
			round necks. Surely the most severe and humourless humans on the planet.</i><br />
			<br />
			Uncle, Aunt, greetings! How nice it is to see you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He kisses his aunt on each cheek. She slaps Blackadder firmly on both cheeks.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Wicked child, don't lie. Everyone hates us and you know it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			May I introduce my friend, Lord Percy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy tries to be roguishly charming.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, well, well, Eddy, you didn't tell me you had such a good-looking aunt. Good morrow to thee,
			gorgeousness. I know what I like and I like what I see.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Lady Whiteadder punches him in the face</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Be gone, Satan!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder guides them into his lodgings where a very polite dining table is set up.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, well. Well, I hope you had a pleasant inheritance. Did I say 'inheritance'? I meant journey.
			If you'd just like to help yourself to a legacy, uhm, a chair ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Chair! You have chairs in your house?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh ... yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Wicked child! <i>(She hits Blackadder)</i> Chairs are an invention of Satan. In our house, Nathaniel
			sits on a spike.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And yourself?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			I sit on Nathaniel. Two spikes would be an extravagance.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, quite.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Nevertheless, Lord and Lady Whiteadder sit at the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			I will suffer comfort this once. We shall just have to stick forks in our legs between courses. I
			trust you remember we eat no meat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Heaven forbid! No, here we feast only on God's lovely turnip, mashed.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Lady Whiteadder stands in horror.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Mashed?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yeees.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Lady Whiteadder hits him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Wicked child.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And she whacks him once more.</i><br />
			<br />
			Mashing is also the work of Beelzebub. For Satan saw God's blessed turnip and he envied it and
			mashed it to spoil its sacred shape. I shall have my turnip as God intended.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Fine. Baldrick!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			Would you fetch my dear aunt a raw turnip, please?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But we've only got the one ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Just do it. Thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			Uncle, will you have your turnip mashed, or as God intended?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			He will not answer. He has taken a vow of silence. I believe that silence is golden.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Silence falls. After a couple of moments Blackadder coughs. The cough sounds strangely like
			the word ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Inheritance.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is suddenly a very loud knocking on the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Edmund, I trust you have invited no other guests.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Certainly not.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Good. For where there are other guests, there are people to fornicate with.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, quite.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The knocking again. Blackadder rises.</i><br />
			<br />
			I'll just tell them to fornicate off. Lord Percy will look after you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder exits. Percy is left on the spot.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ahm, yes. Well, Lord Whiteadder, a vow of silence. That's quite an interesting thing. Tell me
			about it ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: THE CORRIDOR! BALDRICK'S ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters the corridor. He goes to a cupboard and takes out a silly hat and a pair
			of false breasts, which he slip on. He then opens the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Sure enough, it is three drunken idiots: Piddle and Partridge, mutated aristocrats, and
			Frobisher, a gross priest. They all wear silly hats, and grin inanely before bursting into song.
			Partridge holds a clutch of ostrich feathers. They are all also wearing false breasts.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>All three</b><br />
			Happy birthday to you!<br />
			Happy birthday to you!<br />
			Happy birthday, Eddie Baby!<br />
			Happy birthday to you!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder tries to quieten them down, but fails. He lifts his voice for the benefit of the
			Whiteadders ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But it's not my birthday, <i>Archdeacon.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>He ushers the lads into Baldrick's room.</i> Well, get stuck in, boys ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Partridge</b><br />
			'Stuck in' - wehey! - geddit?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Piddle</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Partridge</b><br />
			Well, it sounds a bit rude, doesn't it? 'Stuck in.'<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a knock at the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sorry. Back in a tick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder goes for the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Partridge</b><br />
			Wehey! 'Tick', eh, lads. Now that sounds a bit rude, doesn't it? That sounds a bit like 'bum'.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder opens the front door. It is Melchett.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ha! Melchers. Late, I see, to avoid the early drinking. Oh, Melchy, you really are a beginner -
			you're not even wearing a pair of comedy breasts.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			<i>Au contraire,</i> Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He undoes his coat to reveal a much bigger pair, painted gold</i>.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, well, let's wait till we get down to the serious drinking, shall we?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett heads down the corridor towards the Whiteadders.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			In here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No. It's this way.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder opens the door to Baldrick 's bedroom. All three lads are bending over, their
			bottoms facing three lit candles on the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Wehey!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Good evening.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all turn round.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Lads, this is Lord Melchett.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Give him a large one, will you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Partridge</b><br />
			'Large one' - wehey! - geddit?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Piddle</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Partridge</b><br />
			Yes, you do. Large one, it sounds a bit rude.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Piddle</b><br />
			Oh yes - large one - get it! Wehey!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You may find the conversation a bit above your head at first, Melchy, but you'll soon get used
			to it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder takes a large flagon.</i><br />
			<br />
			Well, down the hatch!<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder swigs his beer merrily and exits into the corridor. He opens the door of the
			cupboard and throws in the contents of the flagon, then crosses to his lodgings.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>There is an unexpected knock on the front door. He opens it impatiently, and there stands a
			cowled woman. It is, of course, Queenie. Though Blackadder, strangely, does not recognize her.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Woman</b><br />
			I heard there was a party on.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			No. Yes. There are two and you're invited to neither.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is about to close the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Woman</b><br />
			But I'm a friend of Lord Percy's.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, you must be Gwendolen. You were invited anyway. Come in, do.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Woman</b><br />
			Thank you very much.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's in here.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Woman</b><br />
			Thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He smiles and opens the door of the cupboard. The woman walks in obediently and Blackadder
			calmly locks her in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			There you go.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He heads for his lodgings, breasts on.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder bursts in, breasts and all.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sorry about that. Carol singers.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder sits. Everyone freezes, noticing the breasts. Percy coughs, three times, in very
			unusual ways.</i><br />
			<br />
			Sorry - he's sick. Leprosy, of the brain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			What he is trying to tell you is that you appear to be wearing a pair of devil's dumplings.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder looks down and flinches in shock at the sight of his own breasts. He then covers
			them with his hands and thinks of a plausible answer.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, my God - my ear muffs have fallen down.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He moves them up, and tries to stretch them round his ears.</i><br />
			<br />
			Would you like a pair? It's getting rather cold.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			No thank you - cold is God's way of telling us to burn more Catholics.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, quite. Which reminds me, Auntie ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>She hits him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Do not call me Auntie. An aunt is a relative and relatives are evidence of sex ... and sex is
			hardly a fitting subject for the dinner table.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Or indeed, any table.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Except, perhaps, a table in a brothel.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder does not move, but somehow Percy disappears under the table. It is clear that
			Blackadder has kicked him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh dear, Percy, you seem to have fallen off your chair.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy re-emerges just as Baldrick enter</i>s <i>with the turnip and crosses to Lady</i>
			<i>Whiteadder</i>.<br />
			<br />
			Well, now, what was I saying ... Oh, my God!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Your turnip, my lady.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy and Blackadder are horrified. It is the thingy turnip. A chilling moment as Lady
			Whiteadder inspects it. Then ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Very good. Very good.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She nibbles one end. Baldrick exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			You know, Nathaniel - this takes me right back to our wedding night.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is shocked at this. Lady Whiteadder turns to him to explain.</i><br />
			<br />
			We had raw turnips that night, too.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Lady Whiteadder takes a huge bite and Blackadder winces. Suddenly, from very near there is
			a loud, drunken roar. It is part cheer, part crash, and deafening. </i><br />
			<br />
			What was that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What was what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			That noise.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Noise? Did you hear a noise, Percy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Apart from that colossal drunken roar.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy suddenly disappears under the table again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, <i>that</i> noise. It's the Catholics next door, I'm afraid.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'll just go and burn them. Back in a minute. Percy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder rises and exits into the corridor. All eyes turn to Percy ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE CORRIDOR/BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS/BALDRICK'S ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a violent knocking from the cupboard. Blackadder is about to cross to it, when
			he notices Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick hands him a red plastic comedy nose. Blackadder puts it on, then crosses to the
			cupboard and opens it. The woman stumbles out gasping for air.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Woman</b><br />
			I'm suffocating!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, thank God you knocked. Come on now, take a deep breath. And another. Better?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Woman</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he pushes her back in the cupboard and locks it again. He then heads out towards
			Baldrick s room; meanwhile, back in his lodgings.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Mind you, I'll say one thing for Catholic they do have natural rhythm.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Lady Whiteadder lunges to hit Percy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>In Baldrick's room, the lads are all wearing plastic noses. Melchett is seated.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Piddle</b><br />
			Geddit? Yes, wehey!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I notice you're not drinking. Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't you worry about me Melchers, I'm holding my own here.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Partridge</b><br />
			Wehey! Holding my own! Now that sounds <i>incredibly</i> rude.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They howl with laughter.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, well, I never went to university, of course.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Blackadder, that doesn't explain why you re not drinking with us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, yes, no, well that's what I actually came to talk to you about. What do you say to the
			idea of ten minutes' absolute silence to get some really serious drinking in?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frobisher</b><br />
			Hooray! Sssssh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Partridge and Piddle</b><br />
			Ssssssssssssh!!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, I said, 'please give me silence', not 'drench me with dribble'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Sorry, Edders.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Now. Here's a nice glass of cider.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett hands Blackadder the flagon.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Only cider? I'm going to go and put some brandy in it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all cheer, then shush. And Blackadder gets out quick. Once in the corridor, he
			unlocks the cupboard and throws in the contents of the flagon. A little scream as he
			throws the flagon in as well, and locks the door again. He takes off his red nose and
			throws it away.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>In Baldrick's room, the lads are sitting on the floor with beer barrels exploding around
			them.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters once more.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, how are we all going then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Not well. Let us discuss your inheritance.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, yes. Good. Little drink first?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Lady Whiteadder stands and hits Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Drink! Wicked child! Drink is urine from the last leper in Hell.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, no: this is only water. This is a house of simple purity.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Lady Whiteadder sits. At which moment, Friar Frobisher crashes through the door and
			vomits into the fireplace.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Frobisher</b><br />
			Great booze-up, Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he exits. A pause. A distinctly tricky pause.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Do you know that man?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			He called you 'Edmund'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			'Know' him? Yes, I do.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Then can you explain what he meant by 'Great booze-up'?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Very long pause. Also tricky.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, I can. My friend is a missionary and on his last visit abroad brought back with him
			the chief of a famous tribe. His name is Great Boo. He's been suffering from sleeping
			sickness and he's obviously just woken, because as you heard, Great Boo's up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well done, Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And I think I'd better just go visit him. Perce, over to you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder rises and leaves. Percy claps.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes. How about some sort of game? How about a couple of frames of Shove, Piggy, Shove?<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: BALDRICK'S ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The lads are still sitting on the floor. Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Blackadder, you challenged me to a drinking competition earlier today, and I haven't seen
			you touch a drop.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Nonsense.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			'Tis true. You twist and turn like a ... twisty-turny thing. I say you are a weedy pigeon
			and you can call me Susan if it isn't so.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder crosses to the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right, all right. Baldrick! Fetch my incredibly strong ale!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Frobisher</b><br />
			My God - not Dr McGlue's Amber Enema?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Pah! A drink for schoolgirls.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Partridge</b><br />
			Surely not Scrollops Lobster Scrumpy?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick has arrived with a jug of water and a glass.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ha! No. It is Blackadder's Bowel Basher brew guaranteed to knock the backside off a
			concrete elephant, is it not, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			<i>(Proudly)</i> No, it's water.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			What?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ha ha ha: but seriously, Baldrick - and presuming you wish to see another dawn ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			<i>(A bit doubtful now)</i> You did call for you incredibly strong ale, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(Pleased)</i> Yes! That's right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That's a relief. I thought I'd made a mistake.<br />

			Fine.<br />

			Hurray! Bums up!<br />

			Percy, I lost the bet.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Edmund, explain yourself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I can't. Not just like that. I'm a complicated person, you see, Auntie. Sometimes I'm nice,
			sometimes I'm nasty. And sometimes, I just like to sing little songs like ... <i>(singing)
			</i> ... 'See the little goblin ...'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			I mean, explain why you are wearing a Cardinal's hat, why you are grinning inanely ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder kneels, revealing a large ostrich feather sticking up from his trousers.</i><br />
			<br />
			 ... And why you have an ostrich feather sticking out of the seat of your breeches.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm wearing a Cardinal's hat, because I'm Cardinal Chunder. I have an ostrich feather up my
			bottom because Mr Ostrich put it there to keep in the little pixies. And I'm grinning inanely
			because I think I've just about succeeded in conning you and your daft husband out of a
			whopping great inheritance.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Is that right? May I remind you cursed creature ...<br />
			<br />

			Oh, yes, damn. Percy, the devil farts in my face once more.<br />

			<b>Piddle</b><br />
			Who?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all look at him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You're ... <i>(singing)</i> 'Merlin, the Happy Pig'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Wrong, I'm afraid. I am ... the Queen of England.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She stands to her full height. They all kneel.</i><br />
			<br />
			I may have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a
			concrete elephant.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Partridge</b><br />
			Prove it!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie grabs a huge flagon for herself and prepares to down it in one.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Certainly will. First I'm going to have a little drinky ... and then I'm going to execute
			the whole bally lot of you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She takes a huge gulp.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIFTEEN: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Dawn the next day. Everyone is sitting drunk in a heap around Queenie's feet. Only Lady
			Whiteadder is missing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			See the little goblin,<br />
			See his little feet.<br />
			And his little nosey wose,<br />
			Isn't the goblin sweet?<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			See the little gob ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Wait a minute! I'm sure there was something very important I had to do to all of you this
			morning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Wehey!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I remember something about 10,000 florins. Was it ... ?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lord Whiteadder</b><br />
			No, I think it was something about an inheritance.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Edmund</b><br />
			Look! Do you lot want to hear about this goblin, or not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Yes!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, well perhaps this time I might be allowed to continue, and perhaps finish, with any
			luck.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Lady Whiteadder appears from underneath Queenie's skirt.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Luck - wehey! - geddit?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Ahmm - no.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Whiteadder</b><br />
			Oh, come on - 'luck' - sounds almost exactly like f ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>The end of the most immoral episode.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>The Ballad Of Blackadder The Boozer</b><br />
			<br />
			Blackadder couldn't hold his beer,<br />
			The art of boozing he's not mastered.<br />
			And I, your merry balladeer,<br />
			Am also well and truly plastered.<br />
			<br />
			Blackadder, Blackadder,<br />
			A bit like Robin Hood.<br />
			Blackadder, Blackadder,<br />
			But nothing like as good.<br />
			<br />
			Blackadder, Blackadder,<br />
			I thought that he had died.<br />
			Blackadder, Blackadder,<br />
			The writers must have lied.
