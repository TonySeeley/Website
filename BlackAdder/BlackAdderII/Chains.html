			<b>SCENE ONE: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is in a towering fury. He shouts at Melchett and Queenie.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Get out, get out, libidinous swine and take that whore slut painted strumpet with you! May you
			both rot in the filth of your own fornication!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett and Queenie are amazed at his passion. There is a pause.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Mmmm. And what did you say to him?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(Massively cool)</i> Say, madam? I said nothing. I simply pulled up my tights and jumped out
			of the privy window.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oooo, Edmund, you are so naughty!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I try, madam, and then ten minutes later when I've got my breath back, I try again.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie laughs.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			And perhaps now we can turn to more important matters of state.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Must we?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I fear so, ma'am. It is a very tragic case. My old tutor, Lord Forrest's son, has been kidnapped
			and he begs you to help him pay the ransom.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Edmund, what would you say?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(Suddenly sincere)</i> Will, as you know, my lady, I have had experience of this dreadful
			situation. Only last year my aunt came to me to beg for help in the ransom of my Uncle Osric.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			So you know something of the dreadful pain involved.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Indeed I do, and can suggest no better answer than the one l gave to her.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Which was?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			'Get stuffed.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Blackadder, you would jest over a young man's life?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			For 'young man' read 'young idiot'. Look, anyone stupid enough to let some moustachioed dago come
			up to them in a corridor, say 'Excuse me, Meester' and hit them over the head with a big stick
			deserves everything they get. Toodle-oo.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie giggles and Blackadder exits with a mighty swagger.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick meets Blackadder coming out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You were in good fooling this morning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I heard quite an amusing story myself the other day.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, good.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he walks straight off and shuts the second set of doors between him and Baldrick. A German
			with a moustache speaks from the shadows. Another German guard is hiding, unseen.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>First guard</b><br />
			Excuse me, Meister.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He indicates the other guard to him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, what is it?<br />
			<br />
			<i>First guard whispers in Blackadder's ear while second guard hits Blackadder on the back of his
			head.</i><br />
			<br />
			I said, 'What is it?' not 'Hit me hard on the head with a ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>And Blackadder blacks out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Immediately afterwards.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			You know, Melchy, I've completely changed my mind about that Forrest bloke. I mean, he's obviously
			very stupid, but we can't go round punishing people for that, can we?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Certainly not, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			If we went around punishing people for being stupid, Nursie would have been in prison all her life.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			A very piquant observation, Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett hands her the paper.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			So, I will sign this ransom, but it must be the last, absolutely the last, final, full stop. never
			again, cross my heart and hope to die.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She scrawls on a piece of paper.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Surely not 'hope to die', Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, all right. I'll cross that out.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She takes the paper and scrawls on it again.</i><br />
			<br />
			Here you are. Sorry about the smudge.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Thank you, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He exits with pomp.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>First guard</b><br />
			Excuse me, Meister.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<i>First guard indicates to Melchett that second guard wants to speak to him. Second guard whispers
			into Melchett's and first guard knocks Melchett out. Melchett falls to the floor.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: A DREADFUL DUNGEON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder comes round. He is tied to Melchett, back to back.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God, God, God! What on earth was I drinking last night? My head feels like there's a Frenchman
			living in it. Where am I?<br />
			<br />
			<i>A groan comes from nearby.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, God. Who's that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			'Tis I, Melchett.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Melchett. You ought to get this house of yours cleaned up, you know. It's a real mess.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			This is no time for jokes, Blackadder. We've been kidnapped.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God. How <i>incredibly</i> embarrassing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			As private parts to the gods are we, they play with us for their sport.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The door flies open and an obvious torturer rushes in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God. Who's that?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The torturer leans towards Melchett with a torture instrument.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Ti prepara para interrogación y suplicio.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now just wait a minute. If anyone's going to be spoken to round here it's going to be me, all right?
			Tell him, Melchett. <br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett and Blackadder swivel round.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Certainly. <i>Parlo con lui; no mi capo.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Bueno.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns to Edmund.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Ti prepara pam interrogación y suplicio.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Melchett settle in their new position. Blackadder is now facing the torturer.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's better. Now, what's he saying?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			He says he'd like a word with you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Anything else?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes. He says he would like to torture you as well.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: THE DREADFUL DUNGEON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is in a torturing device and the torturer is tightening the screws.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right. Now, am I by any chance addressing a senior dignitary of the Spanish Inquisition?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Ti gustava mucho del Inquisicion.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good, because if I am, I wish to make it quite clear that I am prepared to tell you absolutely anything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>No habla, puerco.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No speako Dago. I demand to see the British Ambassador, understand?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Silencio par comenzar!</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, for God's sake. How ... can ... you ... question ... me ... if ... you ... don't ... speak ...
			English?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>(Peeved)</i> No!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He gestures proudly to himself. </i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Yo pregunto las questiones.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right, let's start with the basics. English is a non-inflected Indo-European language derived
			from ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: CORRIDOR AND QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy and Queenie are passing time playing frisbee in the corridor. Queenie throws it to Percy,
			who catches it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			How's that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			<i>(Warning)</i> Percy. Who's queen?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy drops the frisbee.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Whoops. Butterfingers!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			So, I win again.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, well done, your Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They cross into the chamber.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			And there's definitely been no news of Edmund?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I fear not, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Why, then he has vanished. Simply vanished.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(In a reverie of sorrow)</i> Like an old oak table.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Vanished, Lord Percy, not varnished.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Forgive me, my lady, but my Uncle Bertram's old oak table completely vanished. 'Twas on the night of
			the great Stepney fire, and on that same terrible night his house and all his other things completely
			vanished too. So did he, in fact. 'Twas a most perplexing mystery.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Lord Percy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			It's up to you. Either you can shut up. or you can have your head cut off.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy thinks hard.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I'll shut up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: THE DREADFUL DUNGEON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>They have clearly been having a communication problem for quite some time now. Blackadder is still
			in his box.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Batardo.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>Batardo ...</i> Barrister?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Batardo ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Embarrassing.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The torturer jumps off the rostrum and mimes walking with a big pregnant belly. He then mimes
			cradling a baby in his arms before chucking it away ... Basically it's turned into a game of charades.</i><br />
			<br />
			You're embarrassing. I'm embarrassing. Erm, rogering! Pregnant? Baby ... bathwater ... sounds like ...
			bastard! Ah. <i>(At last he's got it)</i> I'm a bastard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Si. Esterminado hijo, hijo.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Donkey.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Padre y hijo.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Big bastard. Little bastard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Padre ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>The torturer mimes panting.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Son. I'm a bastard son.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Di perra.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm a bastard son. I'm a thirsty barking bastard.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>No, perra.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>He barks.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, dog, dog.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>No ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Mimes breasts.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Woman.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The torturer mimes woman and dog simultaneously.</i><br />
			<br />
			No, woman dog ... ah, bitch. I'm a bastard son of a bitch.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			Si! Si!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shakes Blackadder's hand, happy at their mutual success. A triumph for international
			communication.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			In that case, you are a fornicating baboon.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Que?</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, dear. You ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Tu ... o ... you.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Fornicating ... <i>(Begins to mime)</i> Yes, I can't really do it in this box.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Half an hour later. They're actually getting quite chummy now.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Tuos testiculos.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Mmm, yes, my ... yes, those.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Sobre un fuego grande.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Over a large<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Fuego, fuego ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>He does a delicate little mime of burning his fingers.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, fire, fire. Yes, so, let's recap: if I admit that I am in love with.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>No! No!</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>He does a little somersault mime.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sorry, head over heels in love with Satan and all his little wizards ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Si.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Then you will remove my testicles with a blunt instrument ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>Una guadaña. Guadaña!</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			 ... resembling some kind of gardening tool, but we can't quite get which ... and roast them
			 over a large fire.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			<i>(Exhausted) Si.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Whereas if I don't admit that I'm in love with Satan and all his little wizards, then you will
			hold me upside-down in a vat of warm marmalade.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Torturer</b><br />
			Y.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>And</i> remove my testicles with a blunt instrument resembling some kind of gardening tool
			and roast them over a large fire. Oh, I see. Oh, in that case ... I love Satan.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The torturer runs off and returns with a scythe.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, it's a <i>scythe!</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>The torturer raises the scythe and is about to put his testicular promise into action.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie and Percy seem to be in the middle of a game of hide and seek. Baldrick is lying on
			the dais, and Nursie is seated on the stool. Queenie is just finishing looking behind the tapestry.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, I don't know. I've looked everywhere.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Thinking hard)</i> Perhaps ... they're not hiding after all ... Perhaps they've been kidnapped!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie paces.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Nonsense. As Edmund said, only real idiots get kidnapped.<br />
			<br />
			<i>This makes Percy very nervous: he jumps and looks behind him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Do they?<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: THE DREADFUL DUNGEON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The scythe is still poised over the torturer s head. He is about to do his duty, when an
			imposing voice cries out:</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Stop!<br />
			<br />
			<i>A whip curls round the torturer's raised arm. He is pulled to the floor. He grovels and cringes.
			A figure stands silhouetted in the doorway, in darkness but exuding power. The torturer is clearly
			terrified of him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>The man is Prince Ludwig, he is German, and he has a cool, arrogant manner: the Blofeld of the
			sixteenth century.</i><br />
			<br />
			Forgive me, Herr Blackadder, I have been neglecting my duties as a host. Please accept my apologies.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He'd like to think his English is perfect. It isn't, there'</i>s <i>something odd about how he
			says 'apologies'.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(With utter cool, an English gentleman in adversity)</i> I accept nothing from a man who imprisons
			his guests in a commode.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Ludwig ignores the hint of unfriendliness.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			I hope this <i>scum ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>He lashes the whip</i> - <i>the torturer screams and runs off.</i><br />
			<br />
			 ... has not ... inconwenienced you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There it goes again. He says 'w' instead of 'v'.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It takes more than a maniac trying to cut off my goolies to inconwenience me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Good. If he had inconwenienced you, I was going to offer you his tongue.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Believe me, sir, if he had inconwenienced me, you would not have a tongue with which to make such
			an offer.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A tiny smile breaks on Ludwig's face.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Let me assure you, Herr Blackadder, if I no longer had a tongue with which to make such an offer,
			you would no longer have a tongue with which to tell me that if I had inconwenienced you, I would
			no longer have a tongue with which to offer you his tongue.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, enough of this banter. Who the hell <i>are</i> you, sausage breath?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Ludwig steps dramatically into the flickering torchlight to reveal his hard, cruel face.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			You do not remember me, then, Herr Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I don't believe I've had the pleasure.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			On the contrary, we have met many times, although you knew me by another name. Do you recall a
			mysterious black marketeer and smuggler called Otto with whom you used to dine and plot and play
			the biscuit game at the Old Pizzle in Dover?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My God!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Yes! I was the waitress!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I don't believe it! You! Big Sally!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Ludwig triumphantly puts on a West Country accent.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			'Will you 'ave another piece of poi, moi lord?'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But I went to bed with you, didn't I?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Ludwig crosses to Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			For my country I am willing to make any sacrifice.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, but I'm not. I must have been paralytic.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			<i>(Smiling in triumph)</i> Indeed you were ... Mr Floppy!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, all right, very funny, now ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			<i>(Back into his Big Sally voice)</i> 'Such a disappointment fur a girl!'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, all right, you've had your little joke ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			'It really doesn't matter. We'll try again a few minutes. Here, have a look through these naughty
			parchments.'<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder finally snaps.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, well, we are proud of our comic serving-wench voice, aren't we? Just because we can say 'zur'
			instead of 'sir'. Essential at all social gatherings, the tedious little turd who keeps putting
			on amusing voices.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Be quiet!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What else have you got in your astoundingly inventive repertoire, I wonder? A brilliant drunk
			Glaswegian, no doubt! A hilarious black man. 'See you, Jimmy', 'Where am dat warty melon?' Fabulous!
			I can't wait to see your side-splitting poof and your funny little croaky one who isn't anyone in
			particular, but is <i>such</i> a scream! And most of all, I like the one you do all the time, the
			fat-headed German chamber pot standing in front of me!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Ludwig's pleasant demeanour starts to crack.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			You know, you talk too much, Herr Blackadder. I'm thinking it's a case of werbal diarrhoea that
			you are having. I should perhaps tell you that I have given the qveen only a week to reply to my
			ransom demand. Unless she pays up, you die - horribly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			She will pay up. And then, in less than a week, <i>you</i> die - howwibly, howwiliy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			You find yourself amusing, Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I try not to fly in the face of public opinion.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			You know, I think that in a week from now, you'll be less in the mood for being amusing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			At least when I <i>am</i> in the mood, I <i>can</i> be amusing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Then choose your next witticism carefully, Herr Blackadder. It may be your last. Guards! Fetch
			his friend!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The two guards exit and bring in Melchett.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Ow, ow, ow!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Ah, Lord Melchett, we meet again.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Aaaah, no. I don't think we've had the pleasure.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			You do not recognize me then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Nooo.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Let me refresh your memory. You remember when you were in Cornvall, when you were at the

			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Good Lord! Timpkins!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Ludwig faces Melchett.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Yes. I was one of his sheep.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett is suddenly nervous.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			But ... uhm ... one of the sheep, you say? Not ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Yes!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Flossie!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			<i>Yes!</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			But ... didn't we?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Yes, Lord Melchett! Baaaa!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Oh, God.<br />
			<br />
			<i>This is interesting news for Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			But enough of such pleasant reminiscences. The guard has found an interesting document in
			your clothing.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He produces the scroll Queenie gave Melchett.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			<i>(Nervously)</i> Oh, I shouldn't pay much attention to that if I were you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Ludwig opens it and reads it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			The qveen says she will only pay one ransom, and it is, 'the last, absolutely the last, final,
			full stop, never again, cross my heart and hope to be spanked until my bottom goes purple.'
			She has a difficult choice in front of her, has she not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think not. Bad luck, Melchers. Still -'life' - overrated, I reckon.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Yes, gentlemen: if you'll excuse me, I have work to do. Evil plots don't just make themselves,
			you know.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he exits, laughing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie is facing Nursie, who is seated on the stool. Percy reads to them both from a letter.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			'Dear Qveen, I, evil Prince Ludwig the Indestructible, have your two friends and you must choose
			between them. The ransom is one million kroner. Many, a-poh-loh-ghies for the inconwenience.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Golly! What a difficult choice!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Not the first difficult choice you've ever had to make, my little tadpole.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			No, that's true.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			In the old days, it was <i>all</i> difficult choices Should you have Nursie milk, or moo-cow
			milk? And of course, it was always Nursie milk, but then, left breasty dumpling, or right
			breasty dumpling? And of course it was always both breasty dumplings; but then, which one first?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Shut up, Nursie. Oh dear, it's all very confusing. Lord Percy, play a while to calm my spirit.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Certainly, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy hands his lute and the letter to Baldrick, and begins to play. That's ... play ...</i><br />
			<br />
			Patacake, patacake, baker's man - ha ha - you're it! <i>(He tags Nursie)</i> Ring around a
			rosie ... <i>(Dancing gaily)</i> All fall down.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy falls down.</i><br />

			<b>SCENE TWELVE: THE DREADFUL DUNGEON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A week later. Blackadder and Melchett are manacled to the wall.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			What say you, Blackadder - I sing a song to keep our spirits up?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That all depends whether you want the slop bucket over your head or not.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, perhaps some pleasant word game?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, all right. Make a sentence out of the following words: 'Face - sodding - your -shut.'<br />
			<br />
			<i>This is too much for Melchett. He cracks</i> - <i>a hostage who can take no more.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Oh for God's sake, man, we must do something to relieve our minds of the terrible fate that
			awaits us.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Awaits you, Melchy, not me. How's my beard looking?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Oh, alas. Shall I never see England more. Her rolling hills. Her swooping swallows ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And her playful sheep.<br />
			<br />
			<i>At which moment there is a powerful slamming of doors, heralding an approach.</i><br />
			<br />
			About time too.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And Ludwig enters, carrying a letter.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Gentlemen, the answer has arrived.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, thank God. I'm sick of this place. The conditions are just disgraceful. It's like a
			prison in here.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			I will read it to you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Typical master criminal. Loves the sound of his own voice.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			After long and very careful deliberation, the qveen has decided to expend the ransom money on<br />

			<b>SCENE THIRTEEN: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Close-up of Queenie thinking and finally putting pen to paper.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			 ... a big party. Just impossible to decide between my two faves so have decided to keep the
			 cash, have a whizzy jolly and try to forget both of you. Hope you're not too miffed. Byeee.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOURTEEN: THE DREADFUL DUNGEON</b><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			'Hope you're not too miffed. Byeee.' Well as you can imagine, my friends, this make me very
			unhappy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(Very sarcastically) Oh, I am sorry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			But ... if you gentlemen were to tell me a way to ... let us say, gain access to your qveen,
			I might be able to ... commute your deaths to a life sentence.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Are you suggesting we betray her?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Oh, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A moment of great moral choice for Queenie''s most faithful servant.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Blackadder, what are you saying? What of loyalty, honour, self-respect?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What of them?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Nothing.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Ludwig crosses to them.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			So you will both ... play ball?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder and Melchett</b><br />
			Yup.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Ha ha ha - what joy - see how you collapse before me, you great and incorruptible English nobs.
			So proud of your great big stiff upper lips.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Gloating is a sign of insecurity, Ludwig. Stop it. Now, do you want to get to the queen or not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Yes. I thought some kind of disguise. You know, I do a very good Mary, Qveen of Scots.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns and hunches his head below his shoulders, then speaks in a Scottish</i>
			<i>accent.</i><br />
			<br />
			Hoots, mon, where's me heed?<br />

			<br />
			Q<i>ueenie is seated on the throne. Baldrick is lying on the floor Percy is wearing Melchett's

			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			What sort of party should it be?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, fancy dress. I love fancy dress.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Nursie<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			I think it should be one of those ones when everybody comes with nothing on at all.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Shut up, then. I agree with you, Acting Lord Chamberlain. If we're really going to forget our
			woes, we need to have as much fun as possible, and what could be more fun than a party where
			people are dressed up as frogs and rabbits and nuns?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			And bits of wood.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			You're not going to come as a bit of wood.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Aren't I?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Oh. How about a pencil then, should I come as a pencil?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Don't be silly, Nursie, you always talk like this and always end up coming as the same thing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Do I?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			You know you do. Everyone knows it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She catches sight of Baldrick and addresses him.</i><br />
			<br />
			Lassie? What does Nursie always come to fancy dress balls as?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I thought everyone knew.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes. Everyone, apparently, except Nursie, Tell her.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			She always comes as a cow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			<i>(Utterly thrilled)</i> Yes, that's right. A lovely lovely cow with great big lovely udders,
			swinging around going 'Mooooo, come to Nursie-cow, you lovely little heifers!' Oh, yes, what
			fun, I want to be a cow again, please!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, shut up. Isn't Nursie stupid?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			She certainly is, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They both have a laugh at Nursie.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			You see, we're having a good time already. We've completely forgotten about those chaps in
			prison, haven't we?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy chortles for a second and then thinks up a joke.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			What chaps?<br />
			<br />
			<i>And they both chortle.</i><br />

			<b>SCENE SIXTEEN: THE DREADFUL DUNGEON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Melchett are sitting in the gloom. The guards are heard outside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Guards</b><br />
			<i>Eins, zwei! Eins, zwei! Eins, zwei!</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>The door opens and Ludwig stands there, wearing a splendid travelling cloak.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			My friends, I come to bid you farevell. These guards will ewentually die of old age: but their
			sons will, I'm sure, go on attending to your needs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you for your concern, but, in fact, we intend to escape.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			With your information, gentlemen, I intend to bring down your qveen and country. The Master of
			Disguise will become the Master of the World.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Tell me, Ludwig, one thing before you go.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Were you ever bullied at school?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			<i>(Suddenly tense)</i> What do you mean?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, all this ranting and raving about power - there must be some reason for it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Nonsense. No, at my school having dirty hair and spots was a sign of maturity!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I thought so. And I bet your mother made you wear shorts right up to your final year.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Shut up! Shut up! When I am King of England, no one will ever dare call me Shorty Greasy Spot
			Spot again!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He slams out of the room, with the guards.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Touched a nerve there, I think.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			But what good is it going to do if we an doomed to rot here until we die?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Nah! Don't worry. I've got a plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. Now that Ludwig's gone, we should have no trouble in overcoming the guards. Germans are
			sticklers for efficiency, and I've been watching their routine and selected the moment when
			they are at their most vulnerable. That is when we'll attack.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Brilliant. How?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That is the most cunning bit.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVENTEEN: THE SAME DUNGEON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Later that same day. The guards are audible outside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Guards</b><br />
			<i>Eins zwei, eins zwei, eins zwei, eins zwei.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, this is it. Don't forget, when they're at their most vulnerable.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Guards</b><br />
			<i>(Outside the door) Eins zwei, eins zwei. Halt.</i> Jingle ze keys. <i>(They jingle the keys)
			</i> Open ze door. <i>(They open the door)</i> Greetings to ze prisoners. <i>(They step forward

			food, <i>eins zwei. (They spit on the food and Blackadder and Melchett duck)</i> Insulting
			farewell gesture to ze prisoners, <i>eins zwet, eins zwei! The two guards stand side by side,
			thrusting their pelvises forward in unison, their insulting gesture.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Melchett each punch a guard in the groin. The guards collapse, Blackadder
			shakes his hand and wrist in agony.</i><br />
			<br />
			Trust me to get the hard one.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Melchett charge towards the door. Melchett is halfway up the stairs when

			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHTEEN: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy is gaily clad, Baldrick has a pencil up each nostril, Nursie is in a rather wonderful
			cow costume, and Queenie is magnificently attired as Henry VIII.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yo ho ho. Off with her head.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ma'am, it is brilliant. Your father is born again.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Let's bally well hope not, or else I won't be queen anymore. Yours is pretty good too. What is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Nothing. ma'am. Just a mere trifle I threw together.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Mmm, doesn't look much like a trifle. Looks more like a fruit salad to me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I see Nursie has really excelled herself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Moo.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes she has. I'm not sure about this, though. <i>(To Baldrick)</i> What are you meant to be?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			A pencil case.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, yes. It's just like parties I had when I was tiny. We had tea and cakes and venison and then
			a trip with a couple of little friends to the executions.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			How sweet.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			If I wanted any of my friends executed, that is. Oh, how I do wish Edmund could be here. He
			always loved parties and always always wore very, very tight tights.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Edmund who?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Blackadder dramatically ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Edmund Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He strides in grandly, whacks Percy and kneels before Queenie.</i><br />
			<br />
			Majesty!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Edmund! But ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder rises.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Did you ever know me to miss a party!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie is delighted, but then wrinkles her nose.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oooh! But what about Lord Melchett?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, unfortunately, he made it too.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And in comes Melchett, prostrating himself before Queenie.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Rapture! Joy beyond measure! Bliss which cannot be counted on one's fingers!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder makes a tiny and subtle interjection.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baaa.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Sorry, Edmund?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Nothing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes. Unfortunately, apart from my nose getting a little prettier, nothing much has changed
			around here. Your animal still isn't housetrained. Your friend's still unemployed. And Nursie's
			one stick short of a bundle.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Moo!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, yes, thank you for reminding me.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He draws his sword and kills Nursie with a decisive thrust through the heart.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Nursie! You've killed Nursie!! That's <i>horrid!</i> Guards, guards! Take him away and execute
			him. He's killed Nursie!<br />
			<br />
			<i>At which moment, the real Nursie enters the room, dressed in a very bad and silly cow costume.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Can anyone help me with my udders?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Nursie!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes! And may I introduce our erstwhile captor ... Prince Ludwig the Indestructible.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He tears off the head of the cow costume to reveal the dying Ludwig.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Ah! Qveen Elizabeth. We meet again!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Err ... I don't think so, actually.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Yes! Remember when you were young, and your father used to take you riding on a magnificent
			grey pony that you used to kiss and fondle in the stable yard?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			<i>(Embarrassed)</i> Yes, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			I was the tall and attractive German stable lad who held him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			No!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			Yes!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			You?! Shorty Greasy Spot Spot?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Ludwig</b><br />
			No, no, no! You will regret the day you ever mocked my complexion. I will return and wreak
			my rewenge!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He rushes into the corridor, making a break for freedom.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, you won't. You will die and be buried.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder fells him with a well-aimed arrow. All cheer.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Strange man.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			But how did you know it was him?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			This was the information with which we bought our lives. We told him that if the queen was
			having a party, then Nursie always goes as a cow. From that moment, he was doomed. All we
			had to do was escape, return and kill the cow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			But how could you be sure it wasn't Nursie?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Because, Lady, Ludwig was a master of disguise, whereas Nursie is a sad, insane old woman
			with an udder fixation. All I had to do was kill the one that looked like the cow. That was
			the mistake I knew that Ludwig would make. His disguise was too good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Gosh, Edmund, how brilliant - welcome home.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I must say, ma'am, it is good to be back.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy crosses to Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Welcome, Edmund. Did you ... miss me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I certainly did. Many was the time, Percy, I said to myself, I wish Percy was here ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy hugs Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			 ... being tortured instead of me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			How we have missed your wit!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Did you miss me, my lord?<br />
			<br />

			Ahm ... Baldrick, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That's right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, not really.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			And me, did you miss me, Edmund?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Madam, life without you was like ... a broken pencil.<br />

			Explain.<br />
