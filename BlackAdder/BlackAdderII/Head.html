			<b>SCENE ONE: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is sitting at the table with Baldrick, who is looking perplexed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, Baldrick, let us try again, shall we? This is called adding. If I have two beans and then I
			add two more beans, what do I have?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Deep thought, then ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Some beans.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes and no. Let's try again. If I have two beans and then I add two more beans, what does that make?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			<i>(More thought)</i> Umm ... a very small casserole?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, the ape creatures of the Indus have mastered this. Now try again. One, two, three, four, so
			how many are there?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Three.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			And that one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Three, and that one, so, if I add that one to the three, what will I have?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Some beans.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. To you, Baldrick, the Renaissance was just something that happened to other people, wasn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy rushes in, wearing an enormous ruff</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Edmund, Edmund, come quickly, the queen wants to see you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I said, Edmund, Edmund, come quickly, the queen wants to see you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Please, let me finish. What ... are you wearing round your neck?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			It's my new ruff.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You look like a bird who's swallowed a plate.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			It's the latest fashion actually and as a matter of fact it makes me look rather sexy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			To another plate-swallowing bird perhaps, if it was blind and hadn't had it in months.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I <i>think</i> you may be wrong.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You're a sad laughable figure, aren't you, Percy? What do you think of Percy's ruff, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Four!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Some beans and some beans is four beans.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, we've moved on from advanced mathematics. We're on to elementary dressmaking. What do you think
			of Percy's ruff?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I think he looks like a bird who's swallowed a plate, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, that's what <i>I</i> think, that's what <i>I</i> think, what do <i>you</i> think? Try to have a
			thought of your own, Baldrick. Thinking <i>so</i> important. What do <i>you</i> think?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I think thinking is <i>so</i> important, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I give up. I'm off to see the queen.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Shall I come too, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, best not, people might think we're friends. You stay here with Baldrick. Bird neck and bird brain,
			you should get on like a nest on fire.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie, Nursie and Melchett are sitting together.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Grey, I <i>suspect,</i> Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I think you'll find it was orange, Lord Melchett ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Grey is more <i>usual,</i> ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Who's queen?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			As you say, Majesty, there were these magnificent <i>orange</i> elephants, and.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder enters and drops on to one knee.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Milady. You wished to see me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes, Edmund, Lord Melchett has bad news.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Lord Melchett <i>is</i> bad news, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			No. Be serious. Melchett.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Unhappily, Blackadder, the Lord High Executioner is dead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, woe. Murdered of course?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Oddly enough, no. They usually are, but this one just got careless one night and signed his name on
			the wrong dotted line. They came for him while he slept.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			He should have told them they had the wrong man.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			He did. But, you see, they didn't. They had the right man, and they had the form to prove it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Tsk. Bloody red tape, eh? And the bad news?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			The bad news is that, actually, there are simply hundreds of Catholics who desperately want their
			heads snicked off, and there's no one to organize it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I pity the poor sod who gets the job; no one ever survives it more than a week.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I have taken the liberty, ma'am, of drawing up a list of suitable candidates.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, good-o! Let's hear it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett unrolls a scroll.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			List for the post of Lord High Executioner. Lord Blackadder ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Pause. He rolls the scroll back up again and smiles at Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A large black book with golden lettering being read by Blackadder and Percy. It is called the Book
			of Death. Percy is now wearing the tiniest ruff ever seen. Like high wing collar with a tiny frill.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right then. Let's take a look, shall we? Who's first into the head-basket then? Admiral Lord Effingham
			and Sir Francis Drake on Monday ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			That should draw a crowd.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder looks at him questioningly.</i><br />
			<br />
			Well, sailing enthusiasts.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. Better make sure there's a few anchors and things on the souvenir stall.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			'Aye, aye, sir.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Never, ever, try to be funny in my presence again, Percy. Right, Buckingham and Ponsonby on Friday,
			oh, wait a minute, Farrow on Wednesday. 11mm. Who's Farrow when he's not having his head cut off?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			James Farrow, pleasant bloke from Dorchester.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't know him.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy hands him the official execution scroll, which Blackadder signs.</i><br />
			<br />
			Never will, either. And he goes on Wednesday?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Mmm.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's not right, though, is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Suddenly very passionate)</i> Well, no. Now you come to mention it, my lord, there was absolutely
			no evidence against young Farrow at all. It was an outrageous travesty of justice!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, I mean it's not right that he should be stuck on Wednesday, when we could do him on Monday and have
			half the week off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, I see. Yes, that's right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Pop him in on Monday. Right. Good. Five dead in two days, not a bad start. Oh, yes, Percy, and the new
			ruff ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Better?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Worse.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			But the fashion of today is towards the tiny.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			In that case, Percy, you have the most fashionable brain in London.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: GUARD ROOM IN THE PRISON</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Percy are addressing the staff in this stony and dirty room. There is a horrible-looking
			man, a rotund woman and an executioner in his mask.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, good morning, team. My name is Edmund Blackadder, and I am the new minister in charge of religious
			genocide. Now, if you play straight with me, you'll find me a considerate employer ... But cross me, and
			you'll soon discover that under this boyish, playful exterior beats the heart of a ruthless, sadistic
			maniac. Now, my man, you are?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Gaoler</b><br />
			<i>(Shuffling to attention)</i> Gaoler, sir, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good, well done. And your name is?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Gaoler</b><br />
			Ploppy, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ploppy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Gaoler</b><br />
			Yes, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ploppy the gaoler.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Gaoler</b><br />
			That's right, sir. Ploppy, son of Ploppy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ploppy, son of Ploppy the gaoler.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Gaoler</b><br />
			Oh, no, sir. I'm the first Ploppy to rise to be gaoler. My father, Daddy Ploppy, was known as Ploppy
			the Slopper. It was from him that I inherited my fascinating skin diseases.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You are to be congratulated, my friend. We live in an age where illness and deformity are commonplace,
			and yet, Ploppy, you are, without a doubt, the most repulsive individual I have ever met. I would shake
			your hand, but I fear it would come off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Gaoler</b><br />
			There's no many bosses would he that considerate, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Thank you, Ploppy. I do my best.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He moves on to the rotund and dirty woman.</i><br />
			<br />
			Now then, woman, if indeed you <i>are</i> a woman, what is your function on Death Row?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cook</b><br />
			I'm the last-meal cook, sir. The prisoners may ask me for what they fancy for their last meal.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And you cook for them what they desire?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cook</b><br />
			Oh, yes, sir! Provided they ask for sausages. Otherwise they tend to get a tiny bit disappointed.
			Saussies is all I got.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You are clearly a woman of principle and compassion, Mistress ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cook</b><br />
			Ploppy, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, so you are married to ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cook</b><br />
			No. Many people think that, but it's pure coincidence. We did laugh when first we found out. 'Good
			morning, Mistress Ploppy,' he'd say, and I'd say 'Good morning, Mister Ploppy.'<br />
			<br />
			<i>She and the gaoler laugh.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The long winter evenings must just fly by.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He moves on to the third figure, who is wearing an executioner's mask and carrying an axe.</i><br />
			<br />
			Ah. And you must be the boy who makes the tea.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He laughs at his joke.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Gaoler</b><br />
			Oh, no, sir, he's the executioner. But he does sometimes make the tea.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And your name is?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Baldrick, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder whips off the hood.</i><br />
			<br />
			But I'll change it to Ploppy if it will make things easier for you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, thank you. I can cope with more than one name. What are you doing here?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, it's a hobby.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cook</b><br />
			It would be more fun, sir, if he were to change his name - give the place a more family atmosphere.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A family atmosphere! This is meant to be place of pain and misery and sorrow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Cook</b><br />
			That's what I mean, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Gaoler</b><br />
			Mistress Ploppy's a bit of a social realist, sir.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Now then, we're going to run a fast, efficient operation and I intend to do as little work as possible.
			My deputy Percy here will explain.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy takes his new job very seriously am stands on a box to deliver his important oration.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ahem. Good afternoon, staff. My name is Lord Percy and if you play fair by me, you'll find me a
			considerate employer, but if you cross me, by Jove ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Just tell them the plan, duckface.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			My lord, not in front of the staff.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Get on with it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Right, staff, as you know, we are scheduled to execute Drake and Effingham on Monday, Lord Farrow on
			Wednesday and Buckingham and Ponsonby on Friday. But in order to give us the middle of the week off,
			Lord Blackadder has decided to move Farrow to Monday.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A little cheer.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Let's just say he's got time off for good behaviour.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Another cheer</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is Tuesday of the next week. The very beautiful Lady Farrow kneels before Queenie and Melchett.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Your Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes, Lady Farrow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			My husband dies tomorrow. I beseech you even if you cannot save his life.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Which I don't think either of us would want, seeing as how he's a horrible traitor.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Of course not, your Majesty, but if he must die, may I see him?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			But of course. <i>(To Melchett)</i> What's she asking me for? Why doesn't she just go along to the
			execution with everyone else.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Uhm, no, Majesty, I don't believe she wants to <i>see</i> him die, I believe she wants I see him <i>
			before</i> he dies.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			How odd!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Majesty?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			That she hasn't seen him. Well, I wouldn't marry someone I'd never seen. <i>(To Lady Farrow)</i> You
			should take marriage a bit more seriously, next time.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Lady Farrow bursts into tears.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, come now, Lady Farrow, crying isn't going to help your husband now.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			No. Ointment. That's what you need when your head's been cut off. That's what I gave your sister Mary
			when they done her 'There, there,' I said. 'You'll soon grow a new one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Shut up, Nursie. Of course you may see your husband, my dear. And if that horrid old Edmund tries
			to stop you, give him this. It's a warrant for his own execution.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett gives Queenie a scroll which she gives to Lady Farrow.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Oh thank you, ma'am. May flights of angels sing you to your rest.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes, I'm sure they will.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is at the table. Percy leads Ploppy and Mrs Ploppy in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Hup, hup, hup, hup ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So, they're all dead, are they?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yep. All three. Drake, Effingham, Farrow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Splendid. Any interesting last words?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, Farrow was rather moving, my lord. A great, strong man, he stood there gaunt and noble in the
			morning mist and in a loud, clear voice he cried out, 'My wife might have bloody well turned up.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ha! She's clearly shacked up with some new pair of tights already. Right. Well, unless Lord Percy
			has anything to add, you lot can amuse yourselves in whatever foul depraved way you feel fit till Friday.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Thank you, sir. Well, staff, I've got a few notes on today's show. On the whole, I was impressed ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			They've gone, Percy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Indeed they have. Percy follows, annoyed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Team ... Team ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a knock on the outer door. Baldrick enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord, there is a lady outside to see you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Is she pretty?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I don't know, what do you think?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I don't know, do I? I haven't seen her yet have I?<br />
			<br />
			<i>At which moment, the beautiful Lady Farrow enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			Make yourself scarce, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Good evening, Lord Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, it certainly is now. Perhaps you'd like to slip into something more comfortable?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			No, my lord, for there is a great pain in my heart.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(Seductively)</i> Probably indigestion. I'll soon take your mind off that ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b>
			It is my husband.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder	</b>
			Your husband's got indigestion? Well, he won't be bothering us then ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			No, he dies tomorrow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, come on, you can't die of indigestion! You're over-dramatizing. Drink?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			He is to be executed at your order. I am Lady Farrow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah. And what exactly did you want of me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			I wish to see my husband tonight.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not really possible, actually.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She bursts into noisy tears.</i><br />
			<br />
			Excuse me a second.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He goes across the room, and calls out the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick!</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That Farrow bloke you executed today, are you sure he's dead? <br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, I chopped his head off - that usually does the trick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, don't get clever with me, Baldrick. I thought you might just have lopped off a
			leg or something by mistake.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, the thing I chopped off had a nose.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Fine.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns back to Lady Farrow</i>.<br />
			<br />
			So sorry, I've just been consulting my legal people and I'm afraid there really is no chance of a
			meeting.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			But the queen told me it would be allowed.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A very big unhappy smile spreads across Blackadder's face</i>.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Yes, and that if you said no, I should give you this.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder takes the scroll, reads it and does a little jump of shock. Then a huge smile.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, yes, fine, fine. Absolutely. Why not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: THE PRISON GUARD ROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is sitting on a chair, holding a hessian bag, unusually dressed, wearing gentlemen's
			clothes. Blackadder, Mr Ploppy and Percy are gathered around.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, Baldrick, is that all clear?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes. I've killed someone I shouldn't have killed, and now you want me to put a lady on my head, and
			talk to his old bag.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, I want you to put a bag on your head and talk to his old lady.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Right. Why do I want a bag on my head?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			In order, nincompoop, that she should believe that you're her husband.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Did he used to wear a bag on his head then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Ploppy</b><br />
			Young ... young Ploppy here has a point, my lord. Lord Farrow never wore a bag. He was an old-fashioned
			sort of gent.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, my lord, I hadn't meant to mention it, but I have been wondering all along why you should think
			that Baldrick with a bag on his head is going to be a dead ringer for Lord Farrow, because he's not.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Look, cretins, the bag is there in order to obscure Baldrick's own features, and many might think,
			incidentally, that that would be reason enough for him to wear it. Before I bring in Lady Farrow, I
			shall explain to her, inventing some cunningly plausible excuse, that her husband has taken to wearing
			a bag. She can then chat to Baldrick, imagining him to be the man she married, and the queen need
			never know of my little miscalculation.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Ploppy</b><br />
			Why, my lord, that is a brilliant plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Foolproof.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You're very kind.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Ploppy</b><br />
			Although there is something lurking at the back of my head that bothers me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Probably a flea.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mrs Ploppy enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Ploppy</b><br />
			Your worship, Lady Farrow awaits your pleasure.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right, okay. Quick, quick!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He goes to the door and opens it slightly to speak to Lady Farrow. Baldrick is well out of her
			sight.</i><br />
			<br />
			Ah, Lady Farrow, what a real pleasure is to see you again.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			It is my beloved that I shall be pleased to see.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, quite, quite. Though I should warn you that ... he will not be quite as you knew him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			You fiend, what have you done to him?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We have put ... a bag over his head.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Why?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well ... the thing <i>is</i> ... you see ... none of the other prisoners have such shapely widows -
			wives - as yourself, and therefore in the interests of morale of the condemned community, your husband
			has nobly agreed to wear a bag, it was either that or have all the other prisoners in there with you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			How like him to make such a gesture.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. Yes. Well, I'll just go check he's bagged up.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He closes the door on her and moves back across the room. Baldrick now has the bag over his head,
			and is feeling about.</i><br />
			<br />
			Right, Balders, this is it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Ploppy</b><br />
			My lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What is it now, Ploppy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Ploppy</b><br />
			I have located my nagging doubt, it's a small point, but I do now recall that Lord Farrow was
			considerably taller, more than a yard taller, than young Ploppy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder looks around in angry despair and then grabs the bag off Baldrick</i> 's <i>head.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Nhhh! If you want something done properly, you've got to do it yourself. Haven't you anything else
			I should know?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Ploppy</b><br />
			Yes, he had a very deep voice. Big, deep booming voice.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Quite like mine then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Ploppy</b><br />
			No, my lord. A big, deep, booming voice.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, mine's quite deep.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Ploppy</b><br />
			Not like his. And in fact, Lord Farrow was taller even than you, my lord. A right giant, Lord Farrow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, all right, all right. Don't rub it in. Percy, you better go and have another word with her. Go
			on, go on.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy goes to the door and also opens it just a little. He slips outside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Sorry about the delay, madam. As you know, you are about to meet your husband whom you will recognize
			on account of the fact that he's got a bag over his head.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			I would know my darling anywhere.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, yes, there are a couple of other things.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			I am prepared for the fact that he may have lost some weight.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes. And some height. That's the interesting thing. You'll probably hardly recognize him at all,
			actually.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			You'll be telling me his arm's grown bad next.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy is shocked.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ah, 'scuse, just for a sec.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He shuts the door quickly and rushes across to the others.</i><br />
			<br />
			He's only got one arm!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Ploppy</b><br />
			Oh, yes! <i>(Hits his head in self-dismay)</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, well, I'll just have to stick it inside the shirt. Which one? Which one?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Hang on.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He goes to the door again.</i><br />
			<br />
			Erm ... erm ... how do we know that you're his wife?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			Percy Well, you know, you could be a ... gloater.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			I beg your pardon?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			You know, a gloater, come to gloat over a condemned man. I mean, we're up to our ears in gloaters
			here. 'Can I come in for a gloat,' they shout. And we shout back, 'You heartless gloaters ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Lady Farrow bursts into tears.</i><br />
			<br />
			All right, tell you what. I'll believe you're not a gloater if you tell me which arm he hasn't got.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			His left of course. Now let me see my husband!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Right.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He rushes away in embarrassment and shuts the door on her again.</i><br />
			<br />
			It's the left, and good luck.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder pushes his whole left arm inside his jerkin.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(Shaking his head sadly) 'Gloaters'. you really are a prat, aren't you, Percy? (<i>Then, to
			Baldrick</i>) Right, now don't forget, in two minutes you interrupt me, right? No more than two
			minutes, otherwise I'm in real trouble and don't forget because ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Because we're not at home to Mr Cock-up<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Correct.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Ploppy</b><br />
			Remember the voice, m'lord.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy, Mr Ploppy, Mrs Ploppy and Baldrick exit.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, yes, yes, yes. (<i>He gathers breath. then calls in a very deep voic</i>e) Enter!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Lady Farrow steps in meekly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			James.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My darling.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			How are you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, fine, fine. Food's not bad. Apart from the sausages.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Your voice is somehow different.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Going deepe</i>r) Oh, how?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Somehow lighter, not as deep nor booming as once it was.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Now absurdly dee</i>p) Is that better?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Oh, my darling.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She moves towards him but then stops, a little coyly.</i><br />
			<br />
			Call me by that name you always called me to show your love is still strong.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah yes ... Aaaahm, look, do you think this is quite the time and the place for that sort of
			thing?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Please.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ahm, this is the specific, secret little name that I always used to call you. You want to be
			called it again, is that right?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Yes. The one ... the one like 'your little pumpkin'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The one like 'your little pumpkin'. But not actually 'your little pumpkin'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ahm, right then, my little ... pumpkiniwumpkini.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She rushes at him with great passion: he has got it right.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Oh, my darling!<br />
			<br />
			<i>But the moment she gets to hug him, she screams.</i><br />
			<br />
			Aaaarrrrrgggghhhh! Your arm!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What's wrong with it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			What happened to it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm rather hurt you don't remember yourself, in fact.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			But it was only cut off at the elbow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			What happened to the rest?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, well, yes. I got into a little scrap here, with a fellow who called you a nosey little
			strumpet who's always going blubbing to the queen, and we got into a fight and he cut off the
			top half.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Alas!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, quite. Gosh, I think you'd better be going. Lord Blackadder said he was going to be sending
			in his servant Baldrick to collect me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			(<i>In a new intimate ton</i>e) Perhaps, my lord, he is leaving us for a little longer.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, no, I shouldn't think so. <i>Baldric</i>k! is usually very punctual.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Perhaps this Baldrick is doing it out of kindness?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, no. I shouldn't think so. <i>Baldric</i>k! is a very unkind person.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He couldn't be shouting 'Baldrick' louder - but to no avail.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Well, then, let us leap on the moment that we have been given and use it to its full.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Let me do this last thing for you. What wife could do more?<br />
			<br />
			<i>She kneels in front of Blackadder - something very intimate is about to occur.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What? ... Oh, I see!<br />
			<br />
			<i>At that instant, in pops Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Right, that's it. Time's up.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, it's not!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, yes, it is! Come on, out with you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			Oh, my lord, we have had so little time. May we finish what we began, in paradise. Farewell.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder waves weakly and then turns to Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, you bastard, you utter bastard. That was the first time ever, in my whole life. I've
			been on this paltry boring planet for thirty years, and that's the first time anyone has ever ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He is about to strangle him when Lady Farrow pops her head back round the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Lady Farrow</b><br />
			But do not despair, my lord. Your brother petitions the queen tomorrow morning. There may still
			be hope!<br />
			<br />
			<i>She leaves.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Shall I prepare the guest room for Mr Cock-up, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: QUEENIE'S CHAMBE</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The young, attractive Earl Farrow kneels before Queenie. Melchett and Nursie are in attendance.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, yes, all right, then. Let him off. He probably is innocent anyway.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Earl Farrow</b><br />
			My lady, may the heavens rain down radiant jewels and sweetmeats upon you!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Earl Farrow</b><br />
			And may cherubim and seraph.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Out.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Earl Farrow sweeps out, and Blackadder bursts in, followed by Percy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My lady! About Lord Farrow!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I've just let him off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, no, no. You can't. He's a complete cad of the first water.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett leans down and whispers into Queenie s ear.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			'Can't 'is not a word for princes, Lord Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			How very true, Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Anyway, I won't be argued with, will I, Nursie?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Well, sometimes, my darling, when you want something very naughty ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie squeezes Nursie's nose.</i><br />
			<br />
			No, you won't be argued with! Absolutely not!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Precisely. So, Lord Blackadder, I want to see Lord Farrow here in one hour. Meanwhile I shall
			spend the time visiting my old friend Lord Ponsonby, who I believe I'm having killed on Friday.
			Come along, Nursie. Let's see if there are any good heads in Traitors' Cloister on the way.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie, Melchett and Nursie sweep out. Only Percy and Blackadder remain. Total silence.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Percy, this is a very difficult situation.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Someone is for the chop. You or me, in fact.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Uhm, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Let's face facts, Perce, it's you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Except, except ... I may have a plan.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			(<i>Very cynica</i>l) Oh, yes?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			How about if we get Lord Farrow's head and body, and we take it to the queen, except, just before
			we get in, we start shouting and screaming and then we come in saying we were just on our way when
			he said something traitorous and so we cut his head off in the corridor to teach him a lesson.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. Contemptible. Worth a try - where did we put the head?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			It's on a spike in Traitors' Cloister.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God, that's where the queen's gone. Did she know Farrow?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, yes, they were childhood friends.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, if she sees his head on a spike, she'll realize he's dead.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder sprints out of the room, and returns for a split second.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You fetch the body ... I'll cover the head.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: TRAITORS' CLOISTER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is standing uncomfortably in front of a marble pillar, which has a head impaled
			on a spike upon it. Queenie approaches with Nursie as Blackadder tries desperately to conceal
			the head.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Hullo Edmund. Look, I'm sorry I snapped at you just now. You know I'm really very keen on you
			indeed, don't you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, ma'am. As you were keen on Essex.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Exactly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right up to the point at which you had his head cut off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Ha ha, he didn't mind that, he knew it was only little me. And I must say, his head looked super
			on its spike. Are there no heads on spikes today?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Arrm, no. No.<br />
			<br />
			<i>As Queenie moves round, he moves round too, uneasily twisting the head as he goes.</i><br />
			<br />
			No, no. We're training up a new executioner, and he's a little immature. Takes him for ever, slash,
			slash, slash. By the time he's finished, you don't so much need a spike, as a toast rack.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I love toast. Still, must be off to say bye bye to Ponsonby. Would you care to stroll with me a
			while, just if you've got time, if you're not too busy ...?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, sorry, ma am. Affairs of office, etc ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I said, 'Would you like to stroll with me a while, just if you've got time, if you're not too busy ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, yes, of course, it would make the decade worthwhile.<br />
			<br />
			<i>His hands go behind him. There is a tense look on his face, as though he might be pulling the
			head off the spike. A few seconds later ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Queenie are talking, ten yards on. Blackadder's hands are behind his back.</i><br />
			<br />
			 ... and in Genoa 'tis now the fashion to put a live frog to the shoulder braid, stand on bucket
			 and go 'bibble' at the passers-by.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, our Italian cousins!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, if you'll excuse me, ma'am, I've got some business to attend to.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Certainly. But first, Edmund, take my hand, tell me you forgive my former sharpness.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She holds out her arms. There is an awkward pause and then Blackadder does indeed bring his
			hands forward, smiling.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My lady.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Sweet Lord Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie leaves, waving coyly. Blackadder steps forward to reveal that he has tucked the head
			into the back of his tights. He backs away as Queenie moves off, dragging Nursie behind her. As
			she disappears, Percy taps him on the shoulder and scares him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I've got the body, my lord, and I see you've got the head.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's no good, Percy. No one'll ever believe we've just cut it off. It's gone green. We're doomed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Doomed! But wait a moment. That's not Farrow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			No. That's Ponsonby.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ponsonby? That genius Baldrick has killed the wrong bloke. We're saved!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Saved!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Farrow is still alive and we're saved!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, and when the queen gets back from seeing Ponsonby, we'll ... Oh, God!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder sprints off, followed by Percy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			We're doomed, doomed ...<br />

			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			It's not very nice here, is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			It's not meant to be, my pikelet. This is where all the horrid people who don't like you live.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I suppose so. It's a bit smelly too, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Well, course I'm used to that, of course. In the morning, when you were a little baby ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Shut up, Nursie. YOU!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mr Ploppy comes forward.</i><br />
			<br />
			No not you, you're too repulsive. You.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick comes forward.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, your royal majestic Highness.<br />

			Yes, your royal majestic ... thing.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He slips out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			So strange Ponsonby turned out to be a traitor. You would have thought that he' have had problems
			enough with that hunch and only having one leg.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Yes, and that terrible speech problem.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a pause, and then the slow opening of the door. Percy and Baldrick enter with a lamp,
