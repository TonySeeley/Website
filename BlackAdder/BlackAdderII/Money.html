			<b>SCENE ONE: BLACKADDER'S BEDROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is half light. A bed is set up in the corner of the room. We see Blackadder asleep), and then
			notice that there are feet on the pillow next to him. There is a knock on the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Go away.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick opens the door. He is carrying a lamp arid wearing a night cap. He pops his head round the
			door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord, there is someone at the door to see you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh. God. <i>(Rubs his eyes)</i> What time is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Four o'clock.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, I've told you before, you mustn't let me sleep all day. This woman charges by the hour.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick crosses to the side of the bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord, it's four o clock in the morning.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Someone wants to see inc at four in the morning? What is he, a giant lark?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, he's a priest.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Tell him I'm Jewish.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He rolls over to go back to sleep but,</i> by <i>this time, the woman is inclined to chat, having
			been woken. She is Mollie.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mollie</b><br />
			Aren't you going to introduce me then?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mollie</b><br />
			Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b>
			Oh, very well, but I think you're making mistake. Baldrick, I am delighted to introduce you to ...
			I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mollie</b><br />
			Mollie.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course. Mollie. Baldrick, this is Mollie, a dear friend of mine.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mollie</b><br />
			I'm not dear. I'm very reasonable, actually, Baldrick. Most girls would charge an extra sixpence
			for all the horrid things he wants a girl to do ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(Interrupting)</i> Yes, all right then. Baldrick, this is Mollie, an inexpensive prostitute.
			Mollie, this is Baldrick, a pointless peasant. Now may I go to sleep, please?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What about this priest?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Tell him to take his sacred backside out of here. And what's more, if he comes begging again, tell
			him I shall report him to the Bishop of Bath and Wells, who drowns babies during christenings and
			eats them in the vestry afterwards.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Very good, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mollie</b><br />
			Goodbye, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Goodbye, Mollie.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a little crush developing here ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			For God's sake, get out!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			Well, you're a one, aren't you? When you should be whispering sweet conversational nothings like
			'Goodness, something twice the size of the Royal Barge has just hoved into view between the sheets',
			you don't say a word. But enter the Creature from the Black Latrine and you won't stop jabbering.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mollie</b><br />
			He treated me like a human being.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Look, if I'd wanted a lecture on the rights of man, I'd have gone to bed with Martin Luther.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick bursts back through the door, obviously hurled through it, smashing it the process.
			He lies on the floor. Mollie moves up so her head is resting on the pillow.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Baldrick. What is it now?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It's the priest - says he still wants to tall you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And did you mention the baby-eating Bishop of Bath and Wells?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I did, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what did he say?<br />
			<br />
			<i>In reply, the door swings open. In the shadows, dark and threatening, stands priest.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			He said, I <i>am</i> the baby-eating Bishop of Bath and Wells.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is a touch uneasy, and checks that Mollie is covered which, fortunately she is.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good Lord!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			You haven't any children, have you, Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, I'm not married.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			In that case I'll skip breakfast and get straight down to business. Do you know what day it is
			today?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, I don't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			It is exactly one year ago to the day that the Bank of the Black Monks of St Herod - 'Banking with
			a Smile and a Stab' - of which I am the Assistant Manager, lent you £1000. Our motto is 'Repayment
			or Revenge'.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course. And naturally I would have paid you back, but unfortunately, and this is the real bugger,
			I've gone and lost my wallet. Disastrous! It had all my addresses in it, all my little notes saying
			'forget-ye-not' and, of course, <i>all my money.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			That is no concern of mine. The debt is now due. Not to repay a loan is a sin and we Black Monks -
			we hate sin.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He whips the sheets off Blackadder's bed, revealing Mollie. Blackadder is disconcerted for a
			moment.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, yes. Your Grace - may I introduce my mother. Mother ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>The bishop sits on the bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Good morning, my dear. I hope you have not forgotten our appointment?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mollie</b><br />
			Of course not, Pumpie.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			You know, I have a mind, my pretty, to play 'Nuns and Novices', so don't forget your wimple.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mollie</b><br />
			<i>(Giggles)</i> Saucy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			But as for you, <i>you</i> come with <i>me.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>He drags Blackadder out of bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Where ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			To visit the last poor fool who 'lost his wallet'.<br />
			<br />
			<i>And he pushes Blackadder out of the room with his sword.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: A BLASTED HEATH</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A violent sky, a mound of earth, and two or three twisted crosses. A mad beggar cavorts in the
			background. Blackadder reads a tombstone that the bishop has directed his attention to.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			'William Grieves. Born 1513: in Chelmsford, with the love of Christ. Died 1563: in agony, with a
			spike up his bottom.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Beggar</b><br />
			Ha ha, 'tis ever and so nuncle, with the Black Monks. Scream did he, scream and gurgle as they
			skewered his cat flap for want of a farthing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			I think you ... get my message.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The beggar hangs on to Blackadder's leg and is dragged along as they walk.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, yes, indeed. But tell me, Bishop, let me test the water here, so to speak. Supposing I was
			to say to you something like 'I'm a close friend of the queen's and I think she'd be very interested
			to hear about you and Mollie and the wimple, so why don't we just call it quits, eh, fatso?'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			I would say, firstly, the queen would not believe you, and secondly ... you'll regret calling me
			fatso, later today.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He reveals a red-hot poker</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			I will have my money by Evensong tonight or ... your bottom will wish it had never been born.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The Bishop leaves, in great sweeping splendour, coughing and hissing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mad Beggar</b><br />
			Poor Tom's cold. Pity poor Tom, for his nose is frozen, and he does shiver and is mad.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, shut up.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He casually pushes Poor Tom into a big, wet pond.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is pacing up and down, very worried. Percy and Baldrick stand by.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, lads, I'm up a certain creek, without a certain instrument. Either I raise £1000 by this
			evening, or I get murdered. What should I do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			It's obvious.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You'll have to get murdered. You'll never raise that sort of money.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh come now, Baldrick, a piffling thousand! Pay the fellow, Edmund, and damn his impudence.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I haven't got a thousand, dung-head. I've got eighty-five quid in the whole world.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			But you are always boasting to the queen about how wealthy you are.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A cunning web of deceit subtly spun about the Court to improve my standing, unfortunately.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Shocked)</i> You mean you've been ... fibbing?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yup. My whole life has been a tissue of whoppers. I consider myself one of England's finest
			fibsters. <i>(Looks out into the corridor)</i> Oh, my God! Percy!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Mmm?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A giant humming-bird is about to eat your hat and cloak.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, no!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He rushes out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You see? I'm terrific at it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy returns.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			It seems to have gone now. Couldn't you just dip into the family fortune?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			There isn't one. My father blew it all on wine, women and amateur dramatics. At the end he was
			eking out a living doing humorous impressions of Anne of Cleves.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, Edmund, I'm sorry. I had no idea. But do not despair, for I have some small savings, carefully
			harvested from my weekly allowance set aside against my frail old age.<br />
			<br />
			<i>This is a very moving moment. A moment of pure friendship, of pure generosity.</i><br />
			<br />
			By lucky hap, it's just over a thousand methinks, and has for years been hidden beyond the wit
			of any thief.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy and Blackadder</b><br />
			 ... in an old sock under the squeaky floorboard ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>In fact, even Baldrick is in on it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			 ... behind the kitchen dresser.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy is very surprised at this.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			You've seen it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Seen it, pinched it, spent it. And the same goes for the two farthings Baldrick thinks he's got
			hidden inside that mouldy potato.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, bloody hell!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Then you are doomed. <i>(He goes to sit on the floor)</i> Alas. For God's sake, let us sit upon
			the carpet and tell sad stories.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Certainly not. When Lord Blackadder is in trouble, he doesn't sit about.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You won't be able to sit about with a spike up your bottom.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well exactly. Still, I've got eighty-five quid and that's a start. I'm sure I'll think of
			something as long as I'm not disturbed.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter a messenger.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			My lord, the queen does demand your urgent presence on pain of death.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Damn! The path of my life is strewn with cowpats from the devil's own satanic herd.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett and Queenie are playing chess. Nursie is watching. Blackadder bursts in.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Madam - you sent for me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Did I? I don't remember. What a naughty scatterbrain I am. Snap!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, perhaps, ma'am, if I might be allowed to withdraw, I have one or two tiny matters to
			attend to.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Certainly.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He opens the door and they all burst into giggles.</i><br />
			<br />
			That was a terrific joke, wasn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Magnificent!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Ever so naughty!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What, my lady?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I <i>do</i> know why I wanted to see you, and I just pretended I didn't and I fooled you and
			it worked <i>brilliantly,</i> didn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It was terrific, madam. Thank God I wore my corset, because I think my sides have split.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie bursts into giggles.</i><br />
			<br />
			So why did you want to see me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			To crack the lovely joke!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Or perhaps, Blackadder, you don't think the queen's jokes are funny enough for you to be troubled
			with?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>Au contraire,</i> I'm ecstatic about the whole incident. I only didn't laugh out loud because
			I was afraid, if I did, my head would have fallen off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			If you don't start soon, your head <i>will</i> fall off. Now pay Melchy his £85 and run along.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchy holds out his hand.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Eighty-five pounds?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes. We had a bet. I said that you wouldn't fall for my trick and Melchett said you would, because
			I'm so super and you're so stupid. So you owe him £85.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Fine, fine. I mean, it's only money, isn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He puts his hand into his purse.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: HALLWAY OF BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder charges into the corridor. Baldrick is there.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I cannot believe it. She drags me all the way from Billingsgate to Richmond to play about the
			weakest practical joke since Cardinal Wolsey got his nob out at Hampton Court and stood at the
			end of the passage pretending to be a door. <i>(Baldrick snorts with merriment)</i> Oh shut up,
			Balders. You'd laugh at a Shakespeare comedy.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy emerges from Blackadder's room and hugs Blackadder emotionally.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Edmund, oh Edmund, I have awaited your return.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And thank God you did, for I was just thinking, 'My God, I die in twelve hours. What I really
			need now is a hug from a complete prat.'<br />
			<br />
			<i>He pushes Percy away, goes into his room and pours himself a stiff drink.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			But fear not, for I have a plan to save the life of my dear, dear friend.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Look, I'm not interested in your bloody friends. What about me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Thinks he's joking)</i> Ha ha, not bad, Edmund, that's a good one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, all right then. What's your big plan, blockhead?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I intend to discover, this very afternoon, the secret of alchemy, the hidden art of turning base
			things into ... gold.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I see. And the fact that this secret has eluded the most intelligent people since the dawn of
			time doesn't dampen your spirits?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, no. I like a challenge.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy strides out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Balders, I lost the £85. The grave opens before me like a ... big hole in the ground.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I did have one idea, my lord, but ... no it's stupid ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, I have heard there is good money to be made down the docks, doing favours I sailors.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Favours. What do you mean? Delivering messages, sewing on buttons, that kind o thing?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Not <i>quite.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(Light beginning to dawn)</i> Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Are you suggesting that I become ... a rent boy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Well, a good-looking bloke like you, posh accent, nice legs, could make a bomb. Just stick a
			pink carnation in your hat and make the old sign.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'd rather die.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, fair enough, that's all right then. I'll put the kettle on while we wait shall I?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is about to go. Blackadder stop him. He's had a thought.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			With a <i>slight</i> alteration, your sick and sordid plan might ... just ... work!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: DOWN BY THE DOCKS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is dressed up tarty. He looks nervous and leans against the wall. He wears a carnation
			and carries a sign saying 'Get it here'. A large rough-hewn sailor approaches. Blackadder is
			hidden behind the wall.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Arthur the Sailor</b><br />
			Give me a kiss, I'll give you a penny.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder pops out as from nowhere, on the bargain.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A penny?!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Arthur</b><br />
			All right. Tuppence.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right. Go on.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder nods and pops out of sight again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Arthur</b><br />
			Nothing fancy, just a peck. I miss my mum, you see. When I was a little kid, my mother always
			used to ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder pops up again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Get a move on, he's a prostitute, not an agony aunt.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Arthur</b><br />
			Oh, go on, please. Just a peck on the cheek and say, 'There, there Arthur, Mummy kiss it better
			and you shall have a story.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I don't know. Do you do requests, Baldrick?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			What ... kinky stuff? Yeah, I'm game.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Arthur</b><br />
			Please. <i>(He is crying now)</i> I miss my mother so much. I mean, she was like a mother to me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, all right. Go on, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder disappears.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I've forgotten what I'm supposed to say.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder reappears, takes Baldrick to one side and grabs the sign from him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, get out of the way: I'll do it. There, there, Arthur. <i>(He kisses Arthur - horrible
			experience)</i> Mummy kiss it better and you shall have a story.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Arthur</b><br />
			<i>(So happy)</i> What kind of story?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I don't know. One about a squirrel, I suppose.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A little later ... Arthur has his arms around Blackadder and Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			 ... and then Squirry the Squirrel went ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Arthur and Baldrick</b><br />
			 ... <i>Neep, neep, neep.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And they all went home for tea.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Arthur</b><br />
			Oh, thanks very much, me old shivering mateys. That was wonderful. <i>(Takes his arms down)</i> Now
			then, what do you chart for a good, hard shag?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Pause.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A thousand pounds.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Arthur</b><br />
			A thousand pounds! You've got to be joking!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I'm sure we could negotiate.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder hands Baldrick the sign. Arthur winks at Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Baldrick walk straight in. Baldrick is carrying the 'Get it here' sign.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right:	so we've got sixpence.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yeah. Now all we need to do, my lord, is to go down to the cock fights and put it on a bird that
			is a dead cert, but has got odds of 40,000 to 1.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Pause as Blackadder stares at Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Know you of such a bird?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No. But we could make one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, Baldrick, we couldn't. Oh, God. I suppose you have to be told some time. Sit down. What happens
			is, a mummy bird and a daddy bird, who love each other very much, get certain urges ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, no, my lord. What I mean is we could get a mad wild killer bull and disguise it as a bird.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Exasperated look from Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			But it'll be such a strange-looking bird so no one else will back it: but we'll know it's a killer
			bull, so we'll put money on it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Only we will know?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes. If we stick enough feathers on it and hang an egg between its legs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, all right, Baldrick. A chat with you and somehow death loses its sting. <br />
			<br />
			<i>Messenger enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			My lord, the queen does demand your urgent presence on pain of death.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder rises.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You're not making any friends here, you do know that, don't you, messenger?<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie is pacing up and down. Melchett and Nursie nearby. Blackadder comes running down the
			corridor and enters, breathless and panicky.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Madam, you wished to see me ... again<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes, Edmund. I wanted to apologize for the silly trick I played on you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			It was naughty and bad of me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			It was, my little rosebud, and if you weren't quite so big, it would be time fo Mr and Mrs Spank
			to pay a short sharp trip to Bottieland.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Thank you, Nursie. And thank you, Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's all?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes, thanks for coming.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder and Queenie shake hands. turns and opens the door and hears a scream of giggling.
			He turns around.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett collapses on to throne and puts his arm around Nursie.</i><br />
			<br />
			That was very funny too, wasn't it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My lady?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Dragging you all the way across town again just to say sorry for dragging you all the way across
			town the first time. It was Melchett's idea. I think it's wonderful, don't you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It's fantastic. Melchett, I prostrate myself at the feet of the world's greatest living comedian.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, you are <i>super,</i> Edmund. Oh, Edmund, I promised Lord Melchett that I would play shove
			ha'penny with him, but we have no coin. Do you have a ha'penny?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Unfortunately only a sixpence, madam. What a shame ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh no, a sixpence will do just as well.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is trapped.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: HALLWAY OF BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder appears in the corridor outside his room. The place is full of smoke.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God! This place stinks like a pair of armoured trousers after the Hundred Years War. Baldrick,
			have you been eating dung again?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick is just visible with a pair of bellows. Percy emerges blasted and bruised. He is
			ecstatic.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			My lord! Success!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They go across to the table in Blackadder's room, on which there is an alchemy set.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			After literally an hour's ceaseless searching, I have succeeded in creating gold, pure gold!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Are you sure?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Yes, my lord ... behold!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He uncovers a silver platter, which has a lump of something green on it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Percy ... it's green.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			That's right, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, Percy. I don't want to be pedantic or anything, but the colour of gold is gold. That's why
			it's called gold. What you have discovered, if it has a name, is some 'green'.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy face holds an expression of joyous amazement. He holds the green out in front of him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, Edmund, can it be true? That I hold here in my mortal hand, a nugget of purest green?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Indeed you do, Percy, except, of course, it's not really a nugget, is it? It's more of a splat.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Well, yes, a splat today, but tomorrow ... who knows or dares to dream?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So we three alone in all the world can create the finest green at will.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Just so.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Suddenly worried and whispering.</i><br />
			<br />
			Not sure about counting in Baldrick, actually.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course you know what your great discovery means, don't you, Percy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Perhaps, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That you, Percy, Lord Percy, are an utter berk. Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Pack my bags. I'm going to sell the house.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick and Percy</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			There's nothing else for it. I shall miss the old place. I know I've had some happy times here,
			when you and Percy have been out. But, needs must when the devil vomits into your kettle. Baldrick,
			go forth into the streets, and let it be known that Lord Blackadder wishes to sell his house.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			Percy - just go forth into the street.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is trying to sell his house, and going at the sales pitch with gusto. His victims
			are a wealthy but rather timid couple called Mr and Mrs Pants. They have just looked round the
			house and are entering the main room again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And this is the den.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Pants</b><br />
			Oh, dear.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			But I have to tell you, Mr Pants, that I have had an extremely encouraging nibble in other quarters,
			and I think you know me well enough to know that I'm not the sort of man to ignore a nibble for long.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mrs Pants stands by the fireplace.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Pants</b><br />
			I noticed some dry rot in the bedrooms, Timothy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, Mrs Pants, dry rot is as dry rot does. Stop me if I'm getting too technical.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Pants</b><br />
			And the floors are perhaps a little uneven.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Indeed yes, madam, and at no extra cost.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Mrs Pants is now by Baldrick s door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Pants</b><br />
			Strange smell.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, that's the servant; he'll be gone.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Pants</b><br />
			<i>(Laughing)</i> You've really worked out your banter, haven't you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, not really. This is a different thing; it's spontaneous and it's called wit.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Pants</b><br />
			What about the privies?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			When the master craftsman who created this home was looking into sewage, he said to himself,
			'Romeo', for 'twas his name, 'Romeo, let's make 'em functional and comfortable.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mr Pants</b><br />
			Oh, well that seems nice, doesn't it, dear?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I think we understand each other, sir. So, sold then. Drink?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder pours and picks up two goblets from the small table.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Pants</b><br />
			But what about the privies?<br />
			<br />
			<i>It is clear she is not going to let this one go.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Uhm, well, what we are talking about in privy terms, is the very latest in front-wall fresh air
			orifices combined with a wide capacity gutter installation below.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Pants</b><br />
			You mean you crap out of the window?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Mrs Pants</b><br />
			Well, in <i>that</i> case, we'll definitely take it. can't stand those dirty indoor things.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is an hour later. Blackadder is counting his money. Percy sits beside him, wearing a
			strange green brooch.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			There, that's the lot. He only wanted to pay a thousand but I managed to beat him up to eleven
			hundred.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Ha ha, Edmund, you wily trickster you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Credit where credit's due. I just named the price, it was Baldrick who actually beat him up.
			Percy, what's that on the front of your tunic?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(Proudly)</i> 'Tis a brooch, my lord, a brooch cunningly fashioned from pure green!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			It looks like you've sneezed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			It is with trinkets such as this brooch, and here, a ring, that I intend to revive your fortunes
			and buy back your house.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You think there's a big market for jewellery that looks like snot, then?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy is hurt.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			My lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The eyes are open, the mouth moves, but Mr Brain has long since departed, hasn't
			he, Perce?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The messenger enters once more.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Messenger</b><br />
			My lord ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(With heavy sarcasm)</i> Ah, messenger! Thank God you came. Percy and I could not have
			waited another second without you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWELVE: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder rushes in, panting and dirty. At first he does not see Melchett, Queenie and Nursie,
			who are playing ships behind the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Majesty!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Thank God you've arrived. Terrible news.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			The French intend to invade, Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My God!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			So I need some money.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder slumps onto the throne.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Yes, every nobleman must pay £500 towards the upkeep of the navy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			But we've decided to make you a special case.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, thank you, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Melchy here hasn't got a bean, so we thought since you're so fabulously wealthy, you could pay for both.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			It would be awfully sweet of you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Unfortunately, ma'am, I'm in the middle of a cash-flow crisis, and I just haven't any money on me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			But Edmund ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Sorry, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder gets off the throne. But he cannot hide from Queenie the huge wodge in his tights.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			But Edmund, what's that in your tights<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder takes it out, most surprised.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good Lord!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			It looks like just over a thousand pounds.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So it is!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I <i>thought</i> you said you didn't have any?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, sorry, I meant <i>real</i> money: this is a bit of loose change. I must have left it in
			the codpiece when I sent these tights to laundry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Gosh! A thousand pounds just loose in your tights! That <i>is</i> flash! Anyway, hand it over.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Aahh ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Thanks. Bye.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She takes the cash and turns away abruptly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Fine. Yes, well, goodbye indeed. Goodbye ma am, goodbye Melchett. And ... goodbye Nursie.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Although this is his final, fatal farewell, everyone ignores him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Byeeeee.</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>The second he moves out, Melchett checks the door, then falls on the floor, followed by the
			others.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Ha ha ha - silly old Edmund - he was completely fooled. It was a brilliant trick, Melchy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Brilliant, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			And now I'm going to have you executed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			<i>(Utterly terrified)</i> Majesty?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			It's for taking the mickey out of my beloved Edmund so cruelly. I'm going to knock your block
			off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			But, Majesty, I only acted ... please. <i>(He is weeping)</i> Oh, please, I so want to live ...<br />
			<br />
			Q<i>ueenie, 'who has been looking at him sternly, can no longer contain herself as she bursts
			into a huge guffaw.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett sees what has been happening and wipes away his tears in joyous relief.</i><br />
			<br />
			Praise the Lord for the gift of laughter.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THIRTEEN: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder bursts in on Baldrick, who is packing.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right, Balders. I lost the money. I'm going to have to run away.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Why, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, to avoid these monks, of course.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No point - the Black Bank has branches everywhere.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder </b><br />
			Damn!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Suddenly a thought catches him.</i><br />
			<br />
			If I die, Baldrick, do you think people would remember me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Of course they would.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, I suppose so.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			People would always be slapping each other over the shoulder and laughing and saying, 'Do you
			remember Old Privy Breath'?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Do people call me 'Privy Breath'?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, yes. The ones who like you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Am I, then, not popular?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Put it this way, when people slip in what dogs have left in the streets, they do tend to say,
			'Oops, I've trod in an Edmund.'<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The bloody cheek. I'll show them.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Have you got a plan, my lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, I have, and it's so cunning you could brush your teeth with it. All I need is some feathers,
			a dress, some oil, an easel, some sleeping draught, lots of paper, a prostitute and the best
			portrait painter in England.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'll get them right away, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOURTEEN: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is two hours later, at eight o'clock. Blackadder is pacing. Baldrick comes in and
			announces:</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord, the finest portrait painter in England. Mr Leonardo Acropolis.<br />
			<br />
			<i>In steps a man who looks exactly the same as Leonardo da Vinci, white beard and all. He crosses
			in front of Baldrick to Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, hello. Are you any good?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Leonardo</b><br />
			No ... I am a genius.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You'd better be, or you're dead!<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a violent knocking.</i><br />
			<br />
			All right - into the bedroom, beard face. Baldrick - get the door.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick and Leonardo leave. Blackadder takes an absolutely relaxed seated position, reading
			a book. Two seconds later, Baldrick comes smashing through the door again.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			<i>(Dusting himself off)</i> My lord, the Bishop of Bath and Wells.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The bishop enters, holding a skull in one hand and his poker at his side.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			The time has come, Blackadder ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder turns casually.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, hullo, Bish.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			The Black Monks will have their money ... or I will have my fun.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You enjoy your work, don't you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Bits of it, yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			The violent bits?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The bishop puts the skull and poker down and stands behind Blackadder. He starts to massage
			his shoulders.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Yes. You see I am a colossal pervert. No form of sexual depravity is too low for me. Animal,
			vegetable or mineral, I'll do a thing to anything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah - fine words for a bishop. Nice to hear the Church speaking out for a change on social issues.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Have you got the money?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Nope.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Good, I hate it when people pay up. Say your prayers, Blackadder. It's poker time!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He brandishes the red-hot poker at Blackadder who stands up and calmly turns to face him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Fine. Are you ever concerned that people might find you out?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			No, no, no ... I kill, I maim, I fornicate, but as far as my flock is concerned my only vice is a
			little tipple before Evensong.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick holds out a goblet to the bishop. It is poisoned wine.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The bishop drains the glass.</i><br />
			<br />
			Bend over, Blackadder - this is where you get yours. Aaaahhhh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder bends over. The bishop then grabs his own throat.</i><br />
			<br />
			Drugged, by God!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, by Baldrick actually - but the effect is much the same.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIFTEEN: BLACKADDER'S BEDROOM</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is fourteen hours later. Blackadder enters, and gaily opens the curtains, revealing the
			bishop in his bed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Wakey, wakey, Bish! Dear me, you clerics really are slugger-beds.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The bishop's head emerges from the sheets.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Where am I? <i>(He sees Blackadder)</i> Ah. I remember, drugged!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			That's right.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Well, you should have killed me while you had the chance. You have looked in wonder at your
			last dawn, Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, I'm not so sure about that. I did wonder, though, what people who saw this might think ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He reveals the painting to the bishop.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Heavens above! What creatures from hell are these?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, they make an unusual couple, don't they - though, in fact, I think you probably recognize
			this huge sweating mound o blubber here, eh, fatso?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The bishop cries out and lunges for the painting.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah-ah!<br />
			<br />
			<i>He smacks him like a naughty child.</i><br />
			<br />
			No point. Anyway, we have the preliminary sketches. Now, we can soon bang off a couple of copies.
			Let's see. One for the queen, one for the Archbishop, a couple kept aside perhaps to form the
			basis of an exciting exhibition of challenging young artists' work.<br />
			<br />
			<i>The bishop is stunned by the painting and turns sideways to get it in perspective.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			By the horns of Beelzebub! How did you get me into that position?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And it's so beautifully framed, don't you think? Which is ironic really, because that's exactly
			what's happened to you!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			You fiend - never before have I encountered such corrupt and foul-minded perversity. Have you
			ever considered a career in the Church?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, I could never get used to the underwear. What I could use, though, is £1100 to buy back my
			house and £4000 to cover some sundry expenses, 10 shillings for the two doors and, let's say, 3
			pence for a celebratory slap-up binge at Mrs Miggins's pie shop.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Bishop</b><br />
			Yes, yes. But first, one question. Who is the second figure? Who could you have got to have
			performed such deeds, to have gone lower than man has ever gone, to have plunged the depths of
			degradation in order to save your filthy life?<br />
			<br />
			<i>The bishop pulls back the sheet. It is Percy. He wears a distinctly curious, lurid pink and
			black girdle arrangement, wrapped up in chains. A black ruff and a pink pointy hat finish off
			his rather phallic look.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, hullo.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Percy, may I introduce His Grace, the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Your Grace, Lord Percy Percy,
			heir to the Duchy of Northumberland.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy holds out his hand for a formal handshake.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Hullo. It was ... lovely working with you.<br />
