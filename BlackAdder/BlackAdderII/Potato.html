			<b>SCENE ONE: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is working and fed up. It is a gloriously sunny day outside, and the roar of a crowd,
			which annoys Blackadder even more, shows there is some kind of public holiday going on.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy pops his head round the door He is dressed in merry gear, with horns on his head and looking
			suspiciously like a morris dancer He is very happy and excited.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Coming?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			It'll be a once-in-a-lifetime experience.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No it won t.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder slams the door in Percy's face. Another knock. Percy reappears.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Everybody's going.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Don't exaggerate, Percy. <i>I'm</i> not going. Mrs Miggins from the pie shop isn't going.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			My lord, you are cruel. You know perfectly well that Mrs Miggins is paralysed fro the nose down. And
			besides, she is honouring the occasion in her own special way by baking a great commemorative pie in
			the shape of an enormous ... pie.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What an imagination that woman has.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, come on. Edmund. The greatest explorer of our age is coming home. The streets have never been so
			ray. Women laughing, children are singing. Oh, look look, there's a man being indecently assaulted by
			nine foreign sailors and he' still got a smile on his face.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Look, Percy, the return of Sir Walter 'Oo what a big ship I've got' Raleigh is a matter of supreme
			indifference to me.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Now that is too much for Percy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			If you're not careful, all the children will dance about outside your window singing sour puss' and
			'grumpy face'. And you wouldn't want that, would you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I believe I could survive it. Now Percy, get out before I cut your head off, scoop out the insides and
			give it to your mother as a vase.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He guides Percy out and slams the door on him.</i><br />
			<br />
			What a clot. The most absurdly dressed creature in Christendom.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters. He has also made an effort to look nautical, with two little oars sticking out of
			his hat like antlers.</i><br />
			<br />
			With one exception.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			My lord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick, you look like a deer.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Thank you, my lord. You look a bit of a duckie yourself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God. What do you want?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I was wondering if I might have the afternoon off.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Of course not. Who do you think you are? Wat Tyler? You can have the afternoon off when you die. Not
			before.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			But I want to cheer brave Sir Walter home. Oh, dear sir, on a day like today, I feel so proud to be a
			member of the greatest kingdom in the world.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And doubtless many other members of the animal kingdom feel the same way, Baldrick.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is another roar from the street.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, look, will you shut up. Bloody explorers, ponce off to Mumbo Jumbo land, come home with a tropical
			disease, a suntan and a bag of brown lumpy things, and Bob's your uncle, everyone's got a picture of
			them in the lavatory. I mean, what about the people who do all the work?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			The servants.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, me. <i>I'm</i> the people who do all the work. I mean, look at this, what is it?<br />
			<br />
			<i>He picks up a potato.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I'm surprised you've forgotten, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I haven't forgotten. It's a rhetorical question.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No. It's a potato.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Look, to you it's a potato, to me it s a potato, but to Sir Walter bloody Raleigh it's country estates,
			fine carriages, and as many girls as his tongue can cope with. He's making a fortune out of the things:
			people are smoking them, building houses out of them. They'll be eating them next.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Stranger things have happened.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, exactly.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			That horse becoming pope.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			For one.<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a knock on an outer door.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, God.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick goes to open the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			Probably some berk with a parrot on his shoulder selling plaster gnomes of Sir Francis Drake and his
			Golden Behind.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A child is heard from outside.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Child</b><br />
			Sour puss, grumpy face, sour puss, grumpy face, sour puss, grumpy face.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Right. That does it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder shoots an arrow out of the window, as Melchett enters. The child screams, seriously
			wounded.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Child</b><br />
			Mummy!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And another thing. Why aren't you at school?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Ah, Blackadder: started talking to yourself, I see?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, it's the only way I can be sure of intelligent conversation. What do you want?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, I just looked in on my way to the palace to welcome Sir Walter home. I wondered if you'd care
			to accompany me?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I don't <i>think</i> I'll bother, actually. Three hours of bluff seaman's talk about picking the
			weevils out of biscuits and drinking urine is not my idea of entertainment.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			As you wish. <i>(To Baldrick)</i> Servant, my hat.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick exits. Melchett opens a little silver box he is carrying and offers its contents to
			Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			Potato?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They are raw.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No thanks. I don't.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett has one himself</i><br />
			<br />
			I see you haven't succumbed to this fad dressing up like half an allotment in Nottingham Forest.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick enters and hands Melchett his hat</i> - <i>the most ridiculous of the garment. so far, a
			huge horned hat.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			There you go, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Thank you.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You have.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			It's probably just as well you're not coming, Blackadder. You're not very popular at Court at the
			moment and the queen and I have much to talk about.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett exits and Blackadder follows.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, well, I can probably leave all this until tomorrow.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			No, I shouldn't bother ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, no, no, no problem. I'll be coming with you. Obviously the queen and I are going to be the only
			ones even vaguely sensibly dressed ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWO: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>As fate would have it, Queenie is also looking celebratory, in 'explorer' clothing. She has a
			patch over one eye, an ornate galleon on her hat and gold anchors decorate her hair.</i><br />
			<br />
			<i>She is by the door with her back to Nursie, who is sitting on a stool. There is a knock on the
			door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Who is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Melchett, milady.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			<i>(Crossing to throne)</i> Stop. Close your eyes. Now enter.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett enters with his eyes closed. Blackadder is with him, and puzzled.</i><br />
			<br />
			Ahoy there, me shivering matey; heave ho. Right, open your eyes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Thank you, Majesty. And ...<br />
			<br />
			<i>He opens his eyes, and looks around, apparently perplexed.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			What's the matter, Melchy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I beg your pardon, lady, I was wanting to greet the gallant sailor who hallooed me when I came in.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie squeals with delight.</i><br />
			<br />
			Perchance he has hauled anchor and sailed away.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			No! It was me!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Majesty, surely not!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(To Melchett through closed teeth)</i> You utter creep. <i>(Then to all ...</i>) So where's this
			barnacle-bottomed, haddock-flavoured, bilge rat, Sir 'Rather a Wally' Raleigh? I hear he's about as
			exciting as one of his potatoes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Blackadder's a frightful old lubber, eh, Melchy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Indubitably no sea dog. ma'am, with a ho-ho and, perhaps I might venture, a bottle of rum into the
			bargain.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A bosun's whistle blows in an outer room</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			It's him! Oh, God! Do I look absolutely divine and regal and yet at the same time very pretty and
			rather accessible?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			You are every Jolly Jack Tar's dream, Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I thought as much. If he's really gorgeous I'm thinking of marrying him.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			My lady, is that not a little rash?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I don't think so.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			It wouldn't be your first little rash if it was.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Another whistle and in walks Walter. He is the picture of arrogant swagger. Queenie screams with
			joy. Queenie and Nursie rise. Walter bows.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Majesty!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Splice my timber, Sir Walter; it's bucko to see you, me old matey.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			I'm sorry?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			She says hello.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			And well she might, for I have brought her gifts and dominions beyond her wildest dreams.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Are you sure? I have some pretty wild dreams, you know. I'm not sure what they mean, but the other
			day, there was this enormous tree, and I was sitting right on top of it ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Ma' am ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			And then I dreamt once that I was a sausage roll ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Majesty!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I'm sorry. I'm so excited I don't know what I'm saying. Come on, Sir Walter, I want to hear about
			absolutely everything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Then prepare to hear tales of terrible hardship, endurance and woe. We set sail from Plymouth in
			the spring of 1552.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder yawns a little loudly.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			You remember Lord Blackadder.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Walter turns and inspects him carefully</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			No. But I can see he is the sort of pasty landlubber I have always despised.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all laugh at Blackadder.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, quite. Don't crowd Sir Walter, Edmund.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Twice last week, I fought in hand-to-hand combat with a man with two heads and no body hair. I'll
			warrant the most exciting thing that has happened to that limpid prawn in a whole year was the day
			his servant forgot to put sugar in his porridge.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder tries to laugh this off. Queenie is utterly enthralled.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Gosh, you've got nice legs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			While I hold the six seas of the world in my hand, this fellow here couldn't even put six gobstoppers
			in his mouth.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Ha ha ha - he's a complete no-hoper, isn't he, Walt!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			He certainly is.<br />
			<br />
			<i>They both laugh.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			My bedroom's just upstairs, you know.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I apprehended, Sir Walter, that there were only seven seas.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Only numerically speaking. We sailors do not count the sea around the Cape of Good Hope. It is called
			the Sea of Certain Death, and no sailor has crossed it alive.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, well, well. What an Extraordinary Coincidence.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			What's an Extraordinary Coincidence?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder is so, so, so casual.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, it's just that I was planning a jaunt around the Cape of Good Hope myself, leaving a week on
			Thursday, I think.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. And now that - sorry, I've forgotten your name - has returned and the whole Court smells of
			fish, I've half a mind to set off this afternoon.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			If you attempt that journey, you've no mind at all.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Or perhaps a mind that knows no fear?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Is that true Edmund? Do you know no fear?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, yes, I do rather laugh in the face of fear and tweak the nose of terror.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Gosh, Edmund, I'd forgotten how dishy you are.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			You'd never dare. Why, round the cape, the rain beats down so hard, it makes your head bleed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So some sort of hat is probably in order.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			And great dragons leap from the water and swallow ships whole.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I must remember to pack the larger of my two shrimping nets.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, Edmund, you're completely wonderful. If you do this, I'll probably marry you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Now things are definitely slipping away from Walter.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Oh, yes, and who'll be your captain? To my mind, there's only one seafarer with few enough marbles
			to attempt that journey.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, yes, and who's that?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Why Rum, of course, Captain Redbeard Rum.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well done. Just testing. And where would I find him on a Tuesday?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Well, if I remember his old habits, he's normally up the Old Sea Dog.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, yes. And where is the Old Sea Dog?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Well, on Tuesdays, he's normally in bed with the captain.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE THREE: A TAVERN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>A dark and rummy place, where sits Redbeard Rum, a huge red-bearded pirate. Blackadder has
			tracked him down.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Aaaaaarrrrrggggghhhhh, me laddie!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Aaaarrrrgghh, indeed. So Rum, I wish to hire you and your ship, can we shake on it?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They shake hands: Rum inspects Blackadder's hand.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			You have a woman's hand, my lord. I'll wager these dainty pinkies never weighed anchor in a storm.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			<i>(With a hint of sarcasm)</i> Well, you're right there.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Rum pinches Blackadder's cheeks.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Ha! You have a woman's skin, my lord. I'll wager it's ne'er felt the lash o' the cat, been rubbed
			with salt, and then flayed off by a pirate chief to make fine stockings I his best cabin boy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			This is uncanny. I don't know how you it, but you're right again.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			So, why should I let a stupid cockle like you aboard my boat?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Perhaps for the money in my purse.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder holds up his purse, which Rum takes.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			You have a woman's purse, my lord ... I'll wager that purse has never been used as a rowing boat,
			I'll wager it's never ha sixteen shipwrecked mariners tossing in it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Now he</i>'s <i>beginning to test Blackadder's patience.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			No, right again, Rum. I must say when it comes to tales of courage, I can see I'm going to have to
			keep my mouth shut.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			You have a woman's mouth my lord. I'll wager that mouth never had to chew through the side of a ship
			to escape the dreadful spindly killer fish.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. I must say when I came to see you I had no idea I was going to have to eat your ship as well as
			hire it, but since you're clearly as mad as a mongoose, I'll bid you farewell.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			You damned courtiers to the queen, you nothing but lap dogs to a slip of a girl!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Better a <i>lap-dog</i> to a <i>slip of a girl</i> than a ... git!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			So you do have some spunk in you! Don't worry, laddie - I'll come. I'll come!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They shake on it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, let us set sail as soon as we can. I will fetch my first mate, and return as fast as my legs
			will carry me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Aye, you have a woman's legs, my lord. I'll wager those are legs that have never been sliced clean
			off by a falling sail and swept into the sea before your very eyes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Well, neither have yours.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			That's where you're wrong. <i>(He knocks over the table vigorously to reveal two wooden stumps)</i>
			Ha-ha!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, my God.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			No point in changing your mind now: no one else will come, the whole thing's suicide anyway. What's
			the first mate's name?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Percy.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			A nautical cove?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, well, he's a sort of wet fish.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FOUR: BLACKADDER'S LODGINGS</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy looks set for sailing and paces the room nervously. Baldrick also has on a hat, and is very
			calm: he is packing clothes into the trunk. Suddenly, Percy explodes with emotion.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I'm not coming. I'm just not coming. I mean, of course I'm very keen to go on the trip. It's just
			unfortunately I've an appointment to have my nostrils plucked, next year.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Oh, I'm sorry, my lord, I thought it was because you were a complete coward.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Don't be ridiculous, Baldrick. You know me. I mean, I laugh in the face of fear and tweak the nose
			of the dreadful spindly killer fish. I'm not one of your milksops who's scared out of his wits by
			the mere sight of water.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick hands him a glass of water. Percy screams and runs to the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			Yes, all right. I admit it. I admit it. I'm terrified. You see, Baldrick, when I was a baby, I was
			savaged by a turbot. Baldrick you can't think of a plan to get me out of this, can you?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			You could hide, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Hide. Brilliant. Where?<br />
			<br />
			<i>They both look round and Baldrick spots a chest.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			In the box?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Which one?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			This one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Perfect. All right, let's practise. <i>(He sits inside the chest)</i> Edmund comes in and says,
			'Hullo Baldrick. You haven't seen Percy, have you?' and you say. -<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			No, my lord: I haven't seen him all day.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Brilliant!<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a noise outside.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, my God! Here he comes.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy shuts the lid and hides as Blackadder enters.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, hullo, Balders. Where the hell's that cretin Percy? You haven't seen him, have you?<br />
			<br />
			<i>There is a short pause. Baldrick cannot quite bring himself to lie for Percy.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Yes, my lord, he's hiding in the box.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick steps away from the chest as Blackadder kicks it and addresses Percy ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Come on, jellybrain. Hurry up, otherwise we'll miss the tide.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder exits.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE FIVE: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Later that day. Blackadder in sailing gear. Queenie, Nursie, Melchett and Sir Walter are opposite
			him.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, Edmund, I'm so proud, you're just my complete hero ... Oh dear, I'm going all gooey now.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ma'am, I am moved, and if during my journey, I could believe that occasionally you did spare me a
			thought and perhaps ... go gooey again, I would deem my certain death a minor inconvenience.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, Ned. I've written a poem.<br />

			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Madam, I am honoured.<br />
			<br />
			Q<i>ueenie clears her throat: rapt attention.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			When the night is dark,<br />
			And the dogs go 'bark',<br />
			When the clouds are black,<br />
			And the ducks go 'quack'<br />
			When the sky is blue,<br />
			And the cows go 'moo',<br />
			Think of lovely Queenie:<br />
			She'll be thinking of you.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Everyone claps.</i><br />
			<br />
			It's called 'Edmund'. Shakespeare gave me a hand with the title, but the rest is all my own work.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Tush and fie, my tiddly: you didn't alway make such pretty speeches. 'Tis but the twinkling of a
			toe since you could say nothing but 'Lizzie Go Plop Plop. Lizzie go ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Put a bung in it, Nursie. Now. I'm sure that Melchy and Wally want to say something as well.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Yes, indeed. <i>(He crosses to Blackadder)</i> Goodbye, Blackadder: I'd say 'Bon Voyage', but
			there's no point: you'll be dead in three months.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I love you, Walter: I hope you know that.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett presents Blackadder with a map.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Farewell, Blackadder. The foremost cartographers of the land have prepared this for you. It's a
			map of the area that you will be traversing.<br />
			<br />
			<i>It is blank.</i><br />
			<br />
			They'd be very grateful if you could just fill it in as you go along. Goodbye.<br />
			<br />
			<i>From outside there is a strange and chilling cry.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			What's that?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Enter Rum, being pushed by Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			To Tilbury, me hearties: the wind is in the sails, the oars are in the rollocks, and we must away!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Lady, it is my captain. Long on beard, short on legs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, Captain: I wish you luck from the bottom of my heart.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick pushes the captain to Queenie.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			You have a woman's bottom, my lady. I'll wager that sweet round pair of peaches has never been
			forced twixt two splintered planks to plug a leak and save a ship.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			It certainly hasn't and I'm quite pleased about it. Anyway, what's wrong with women's bottoms?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Not big enough, ma am.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Rum clocks her and crosses to her. It's love at first glimpse.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Mine might be.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			In that case, my little pudding of delight, let us beat around the bush no longer. I know I'm only
			a bluff old cove with no legs and a beard you could lose a badger in, but if you'll take me, I'm
			willing to be captain of your ship for ever. What do you say?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Oh, yes, please.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			I'll be back. We'll all be back.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick and Percy wheel Rum out.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, Edmund: then this is it. Have you got clean underwear, and don't eat foreign food and watch
			out for strange men and discover me a country and bring me back a vegetable and ... oh, everything.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Madam, I shall do all I can. Farewell ... And ... don't wait up.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder closes the door on Queenie. She turns to face Melchett, Nursie and Sir Walter.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Gosh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Well, that's the last we'll see of him. In three months' time he'll he dead as a dead dodo.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			<i>(Sadly)</i> Oh, Sir Walter, really.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett is very amused by her ditty.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Sir Walter Really. Ha!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SIX: RUM'S CABIN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is a cramped, wooden cabin, home to seafarers for hundreds of years. The table is laden with
			food. Baldrick is serving Rum, Blackadder and Percy. Rum and Blackadder have large tankards in
			their hands.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Aaaarrrrrgggghhhhh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Aaaarrrrrgggghhhhh!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Aaaarrrrrgggghhhhh!<br />
			<br />
			<i>But Percy does not 'Aaaarrrrrgggghhhhh'.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Not joining us in the 'Aaaarrrrrgggghhhhhs', Percy?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			No. I'm thinking of England and the girl I left behind me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God. I didn't know you had a girl.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, yes. Lady Caroline Fairfax.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Caroline! I didn't know you knew her.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, yes. I even touched her once.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Touched her what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Her, once. In a corridor.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I've never heard it called that before. Still when you get home in six months, you'll be a hero:
			she might even let you get your hands on her twice.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			I fear not.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Why not?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			<i>(With massive passion)</i> Because we'll never get home. We're doomed, doomed! Condemned to a
			watery grave with a captain who's legless.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Rubbish. I've hardly touched a drop.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			No, I mean, you haven't got any legs.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Oh, yes, you're right there. Carry on. Sorry.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, God! We've got no hope! No hope o ever returning!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			On the contrary: we are certain to return.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Because, me old salts, we are not going to the Cape of Good Hope at all.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			We are, in fact, going to France.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			France?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			But Edmund, surely France has already been discovered - by the French for a start?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Precisely. It's a trick - we just camp down in the Dordogne for six months, get a good suntan,
			come home, pretend we've been round the cape and get all the glory.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			A masterly plan, me young master, and one that leads me to make an announcement meself.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And what's that, Rum?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Truth is, I don't know the way to the Cape of Good Hope anyway.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Good Lord. What were you going to do?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Oh, what I usually do. Sail round and round the Isle of Wight until everyone gets dizzy and
			head for home.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			You old rascal! Still, who cares? By the day after tomorrow, we shall be in Calais! Captain,
			set sail for France!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Aye, aye, sir!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The light fades on our intrepid heroes.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE SEVEN: RUM'S CABIN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is the day after the day after tomorrow</i> . .<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			So you don't know the way to France, either?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			No, I must confess that too.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder nods. Takes in this important news.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Bugger.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE EIGHT: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Time is hanging heavy back home.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			He's only been gone three days and I'm missing him already.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Well, perhaps, ma'am, I might amuse you still further with tales of my adventures.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Like what?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Perhaps you would like to hear the one about the mad pirate king whose crew consisted entirely
			of men called Roger?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Heard it.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Well, maybe I could distract you with the tale of the time I fell into the water and was almost
			eaten by a hammerhead shark.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Yes, all right. Try that one.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Well, ma'am. I fell into the water, and was almost eaten by a shark, and the funny thing is, its
			head was exactly the same shape as a hammer.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Pause. Total boredom.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh. God. You'd better come up with some presents, or I'm going to go <i>off</i> explorers completely,
			you know.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Queenie starts to leave.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Ma 'am.<br />
			<br />
			<i>But just before she does, she turns to face Walter.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			And I'll tell you something else. Edmund was right. You do smell of fish. Pooey!<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE NINE: RUM'S CABIN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder finally lifts his head from his hands.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Look, there's no need to panic. Someone in the crew will know how to steer this thing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			The crew, milord?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, the crew.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			What crew?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I was under the impression that it's common maritime practice for a ship to have a crew.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Opinion is divided on the subject.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Really?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Yes. All the other captains say it is, and I say it isn't.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God. Mad as a brush.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TEN: QUEENIE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>It is six months later. Queenie is swiping the globe in bored impatience. Nursie and Melchett
			stand by.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Sir Walter's death warrant for your signature, ma am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Good. Any news of Edmund?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Well, ma'am. If they are on course, they should be nearing the urine-drinking stage by now.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, don't be horrid, Melchy. Edmund would rather die.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			I fear that may be wishful thinking, Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE ELEVEN: RUM'S CABIN</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder, depressed. There is a knock on the door.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Enter.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Percy and Baldrick come in, carrying empty wine bottles.</i><br />
			<br />
			So soon?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			You said today.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, well, I'm not feeling very thirsty at the moment. I mean, I had an eggcup full of stagnant
			water three weeks ago.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Pause. He stares at the empty glasses on the table.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, all right. Come on, let's get on with it. <i>And he takes his bottle.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Shall we drink each other's, or stick to our own?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Baldrick!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Sorry, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Is Captain Rum joining us for this bring-a-sample party, or is he going to sit this one out?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Oh, no, he's been swigging his for ages. Says he likes it. Actually, come to think of it, he
			started before the water ran out.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God. Well, let's get on with it.<br />
			<br />
			<i>A mysterious darkness falls over the proceedings. Ten minutes later..</i>.<br />
			<br />
			It's always the same, isn't it? You get all keyed up then you can't go.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Me too.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			I've done two bottles.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			All right then, pour it out. That it should come to this. Drinking Baldrick's water. <br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Say when.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			When.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He is handed a bottle. They are about to drink.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Down the hatch!<br />
			<br />
			<i>The terrible moment is upon them</i> -<i>when ...</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Land ahoy!<br />
			<br />
			<i>They all look up. Blackadder's face beams with instant satisfaction. They hit land with a
			bump.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah - France at last!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			No, me young master, for through fair winds and fine seamanship, our vessel has once more fetched
			up on the shores of old Blighty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			By a lucky chance, we have landed at Southampton Dock.<br />
			<br />
			<b>All</b><br />
			Hurray!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Rum</b><br />
			Fare thee well. Last one up the Old Sea Dog gets a lick of the cat.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Rum leaves and Baldrick peers out the window.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Doesn't look much like Southampton to me, my lord.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			What?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			All those streams of molten lava, the steamy mangrove swamp and that crowd of beckoning natives
			rubbing their tummies and pointing to a large pot.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Oh, God.<br />
			<br />
			<b>SCENE TWELVE: QUEENLE'S CHAMBER</b><br />
			<br />
			<i>Two years later. Melchett, Nursie and Queenie are in their traditional positions. Sir Walter
			Raleigh is standing in the corner.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			And where are they now?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			If they haven't been eaten by cannibals, ma'am, they should be back any minute now.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder bursts in with Percy and Baldrick.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Edmund, you're alive!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			And your silly friend.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Lord Percy, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			And your monkey.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Baldrick</b><br />
			Your Majesty.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			But where is Captain Rum?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Bad news, milady. Rum is dead.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Nursie cries</i> - <i>the sorrow and disbelief of true love lost.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Do not despair, good woman. He died a hero's death, giving his life that his friends might live.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			And that his enemies might have something to go with their potatoes.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			You mean they put him in the pot ...?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes. Your fiancé was only a third-rate sailor, but a first-rate second course.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Nursie cries again.</i><br />
			<br />
			How ever, we did manage to save something of him as a memento.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He produces Rum's beard.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Nursie</b><br />
			Oh, my lucky stars. I shall wear it always to remind me of him.<br />
			<br />
			<i>She puts it on.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			However, ma'am, I am now returned, and my mind cannot help remembering talk of wedding bells.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			No. I'm completely bored with explorers and if you haven't brought me any presents, I'm going
			to have you executed.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ma'am!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			I only let Raleigh off because he blubbed on his way to the block. Presents please.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Blackadder searches for an idea.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, ma'am, yes. Well, there was <i>one</i> thing, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Good.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A most extraordinary gift from the island paradise we visited.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Hurry up.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He takes out a boomerang, gives it to</i> Q<i>ueenie.</i><br />
			<br />
			What is it?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			A stick.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Is it a stick, Lord Blackadder?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, ma'am, but 'tis a very special stick, because when you throw it away ... it comes back.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Well, that's no good, is it? Because when I throw things away, I don't want them to come back.
			You! <i>(To Percy)</i> Get rid of it!<br />
			<br />
			<b>Percy</b><br />
			Certainly, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He throws it out into the corridor.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			What else have you brought?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Yes, well. There was very little time, what with picking the weevils out of biscuits, and ...<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Melchy, what did I do with that spare death warrant?<br />
			<br />
			<i>Melchett and Sir Walter look smug at Blackadder's downfall. At which moment the boomerang
			comes back and knocks Percy unconscious. Queenie is highly amused.</i><br />
			<br />
			Oh, Edmund, it's wonderful.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			But what about Melchy and Wally? You must have brought something for them as well. Nursie's
			got her beard, I've got my stick, what about the two boys?<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			Ah, yes. There was one thing, ma'am.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Good.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He goes to Baldrick and turns, smiling, with a very familiar bottle, filled with yellowish
			liquid.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			A fine wine from the Far East. A most delicious beverage.<br />
			<br />
			<i>Baldrick produces two tankards from his bag and Blackadder fills them for Melchett and Walter.
			They are eager to try it.</i><br />
			<br />
			<b>Queen</b><br />
			Oh, good. Have a taste, boys. Tell us what you think.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Walter</b><br />
			Mmm, it certainly has plenty of nose.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Melchett</b><br />
			Ah, yes, this is very familiar.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Blackadder</b><br />
			I'm sure you'll be glad to hear there is an inexhaustible supply of the stuff.<br />
			<br />
			<i>He turns and hands the bottle back to Baldrick. They smile at each other.</i><br />
