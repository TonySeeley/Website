			<h2>So, why have an area of my web site dedicated to BlackAdder?</h2>
			<p />For me, BlackAdder has been one of the funniest comedy's on TV ever! Excellent scripts, brilliantly acted and fantastically funny.
			<p />I was never a major fan of the first series, but once Ben Elton teamed up with Richard Curtis I think they struck gold. The unbelievable level of sarcasm and irony delivered by BlackAdder continually has me in fits of laughter.
			<p />BlackAdder isn't for everyone however, my wife Lisa just does not find it at all funny, which in some perverse way makes it even funnier for me.
			<p />I have watched the episodes so many times I have almost memorised the scripts (how sad) and have found, much to my delight, that BlackAdder's insults and smart retorts have stood me in good stead over the years.
			<p />This site contains the four series, yes, I know there were some special one offs and who knows one day I may put those on the site too. But for now it's just the four series.
			<p />In the future I hope to create a Favourites page that will contain my Favourite insults, retorts and monologs.
			<p />Finally I have to give some thanks and apology's. Thanks to Ben Elton and Richard Curtis for some great scripts and of course Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, Tim Mclnnerny, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie and the rest of the cast for some fantastic acting. Last and by no means least sorry to Lisa (my wife) for being such an incredible bore.
			<p />So, if you love the humour read on and enjoy ...
			<p />Tony Seeley
