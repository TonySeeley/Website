			<h2>Glycemic Index</h2>
			<h3>Diet Experience</h3>
			This was an interesting area for me.  I had had some luck when I was younger losing weight by cutting out potatoes and bread.  But back then I knew nothing of foods glycemic index.
			<p />
			I have since learned how to use the glycemic index to help pick good foods.
			<p />
			For example I never have White Bread, White Rice or Pasta, Corn, Banana's and Cherries.  All of which have a high glycemic index.
			<p />
			I do though have foods that are grain based that are lower in the index.  Whole wheat foods are fine and I continued to successfully lose weight when eating whole wheat bread.
			<p />
			I tried whole wheat pasta and brown rice but have to say I didn't like them that much so  just don't eat them.
			<p />
			This is quite hard as pasta is the thing I miss most.
			<p />
			<h3>General Information</h3>
			A new system for classifying carbohydrates calls into question many of the old assumptions about how carbohydrates affect health. This new system, known as the glycemic index, measures how fast and how far blood sugar rises after you eat a food that contains carbohydrates.
			<p />
			White bread, for example, is converted almost immediately to blood sugar, causing it to spike rapidly. It's classified as having a high glycemic index. Brown rice, in contrast, is digested more slowly, causing a lower and more gentle change in blood sugar. It has a low glycemic index.
			<p />
			Diets filled with high-glycemic-index foods, which cause quick and strong increases in blood sugar levels, have been linked to an increased risk for both diabetes and heart disease. On the other hand, lower GI foods have been shown to help control type 2 diabetes.
			<p />
			One of the most important factors that determine a food's glycemic index is how highly processed its carbohydrates are. Processing carbohydrates removes the fiber-rich outer bran and the vitamin- and mineral-rich inner germ, leaving mostly the starchy endosperm.
			<p />
			Other factors that influence how quickly the carbohydrates in food raise blood sugar include:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Fiber content.</b> Fiber shields the starchy carbohydrates in food immediate and rapid attack by digestive enzymes. This slows the release of sugar molecules into the bloodstream.</li>
				<li><b>Ripeness.</b> Ripe fruits and vegetables tend to have more sugar than unripe ones, and so tend to have a higher glycemic index.</li>
				<li><b>Type of starch.</b> Starch comes in many different configurations. Some are easier to break into sugar molecules than others. The starch in potatoes, for example, is digested and absorbed into the bloodstream relatively quickly.</li>
				<li><b>Fat content and acid content.</b> The more fat or acid a food contains, the slower its carbohydrates are converted to sugar and absorbed into the bloodstream.</li>
				<li><b>Physical form.</b> Finely ground grain is more rapidly digested, and so has a higher glycemic index, than more coarsely ground grain.</li>
			</ul>
			All these elements lead to sometimes counterintuitive results. Some foods that contain complex carbohydrates, such as potatoes, quickly raise blood sugar levels, while some foods that contain simple carbohydrates, such as whole fruit, raise blood sugar levels more slowly.
			<p />
			There is one thing that a food's glycemic index does not tell us: the relative amount of carbohydrate in a given food. Take watermelon as an example; the sweet-tasting fruit has a high glycemic index. But a slice of watermelon has only a small amount of carbohydrate per serving (as the name suggests, watermelon is made up mostly of water). Looking at the glycemic index alone may not tell us everything we need to know about a food's impact on blood sugar levels. So researchers have developed a new way of classifying foods that takes into account both the amount of carbohydrate in the food and the impact of that carbohydrate on blood sugar levels. This measure is called the glycemic load. A food's glycemic load is determined by multiplying its glycemic index by the amount of carbohydrate it contains.

			Although the fine points of the glycemic index and glycemic load may seem complicated, the basic message is simple: <b>Whenever possible, replace highly processed grains, cereals, and sugars with minimally processed whole-grain products.</b> And only eat potatoes - once on the list of preferred complex carbohydrates - occasionally because of their high glycemic index and glycemic load.
