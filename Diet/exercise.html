			<h1>Exercise</h1>
			<h2>Diet Experience</h2>
			In the past I have been the proverbial couch potato.
			<p />
			I used to exercise in the army but can honestly say have never enjoyed it.  I knew exercise was a big part of the program, and was dreading it.  I was concerned I wouldn't be able to keep it up and I certainly knew I would never enjoy it.
			<p />
			So you can imagine my surprise, when going to the gym became enjoyable.  In fact if I missed a gym session, I actually found I was depressed.
			<p />
			The personal trainers were fantastic, they started me off with gentle cardio exercise (basically walking on a treadmill at an incline) and some basic weight training.
			<p />
			I would spend about 40 minutes on the cardio equipment and half an hour on the weigh machines.
			<p />
			The rest of the time (to take up an hour and half) was spent taking blood pressure warming up and stretching at the end.
			<p />
			As my weight came off I found I could exercise harder and progressed from walking to gentle jogging.  I started the diet at the end of July and entered the Seattle Jingle Bell 5K run in December.  My time was not great (about 36 minutes) but that didn't matter, I had improved enormously.
			<p />
			By that time I was running regularly and had moved to free weights.
			<p />
			The weight training was important as it ensured I lost fat and not muscle.
			<p />
			Eventually, I brought my own weights for home and still regularly go to the gym.
			<p />
			I increased my fitness to the point where I was running 5 miles each time I went to the gym and had increase my 5K time to 26 minutes (something I consider quite respectable).
			<p />
			<h2>General Information</h2>
			Although there are no sure-fire recipes for good health, the mixture of healthy eating and regular exercise comes awfully close. Most of this site is dedicated to singing the praises of a good diet. This is where exercise gets its due.
			<p />
			Regular exercise or physical activity can do everyone a world of good. It helps prevent heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and a host of other diseases, and is a key ingredient for losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight.
			<p />
			With all these good things going for it, it's mind boggling that only a minority of Americans get enough exercise or leisure-time physical activity to benefit.
			<p />
			<h3>Body-wide benefits</h3>
			Studies that have followed the health of large groups of people for many years, as well as short-term studies of the physiologic effects of exercise, all point in the same direction: <b>A sedentary (inactive) lifestyle increases the chances of becoming overweight and developing a number of chronic diseases.</b> Exercise or regular physical activity helps many of the body's systems function better and keeps a host of diseases at bay. According to the US Surgeon General's report, Physical Activity and Health, regular physical activity:
			<p />
			<ul>
				<li>improves your chances of living longer and living healthier</li>
				<li>helps protect you from developing heart disease or its precursors, high blood pressure and high cholesterol</li>
				<li>helps protect you from developing certain cancers, including colon and breast cancer</li>
				<li>helps prevent or control type 2 diabetes (what was once called adult-onset diabetes)</li>
				<li>helps prevent arthritis and may help relieve pain and stiffness in people with this condition</li>
				<li>helps prevent the insidious loss of bone known as osteoporosis</li>
				<li>reduces the risk of falling among older adults</li>
				<li>relieves symptoms of depression and anxiety and improves mood</li>
				<li>controls weight</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The cost of inactivity</h3>
			If exercise and regular physical activity benefit the body, a sedentary lifestyle does the opposite. According to analyses by Graham Colditz, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, the direct medical cost of inactivity is at least $24 billion a year. An analysis of health-care costs by a team from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that because individuals who are physically active have significantly lower annual direct medical costs than those who are inactive, getting people to become more active could cut yearly medical costs in the U.S. by more than $70 billion.
			<p />
			<h3>Reaping the benefits</h3>
			A wealth of studies have established the benefits of exercise. Yet two related - and very practical - questions remain: What is the best kind of exercise? and How much exercise do we need each day?
			<p />
			<h3>Cardiovascular Exercise</h3>
			If you don't currently exercise and aren't very active during the day, any increase in exercise or physical activity is good for you. Some studies show that walking briskly for even one to two hours a week (15 to 20 minutes a day) starts to decrease the chances of having a heart attack or stroke, developing diabetes, or dying prematurely.
			<p />
			The U.S. Surgeon General, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine, recommend getting a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most days of the week. You can do all 30 minutes at once or break it up into 10- or 15-minute periods.
			<p />
			Moderate intensity exercise or physical activity is activity that causes a slight but noticeable increase in breathing and heart rate. One way to gauge moderate activity is with the "talk test" - exercising hard enough to break a sweat but not so hard you can't comfortably carry on a conversation.
			<p />
			Exercise experts measure activity a different way. They talk about metabolic equivalents, or METs. One MET is defined as the energy it takes to sit quietly. For the average adult, this is about one calorie per every 2.2 pounds of body weight per hour someone who weighs 160 pounds would burn approximately 70 calories an hour while sitting or sleeping.
			<p />
			Moderate intensity activities are those that get you moving fast enough or strenuously enough to burn off three to six times as much energy per minute as you do when you are sitting quietly, or exercises that clock in at 3-6 METs.
			<p />
			Brisk walking fills the bill for moderate-intensity activity. How fast is brisk? For the average person, it means walking 3-4 miles an hour, or about as fast as you'd walk if you were late for an important appointment. Walking is an ideal exercise for many people - it doesn't require any special equipment, can be done any time and any place, and is generally very safe.

			What's more, studies such as the Nurses' Health Study, Health Professionals Follow-up Study, Women's Health Study, Harvard Alumni Health Study, National Health Interview Survey, Women's Health Initiative, Honolulu Heart Program, and others have demonstrated that this simple form of exercise substantially reduces the chances of developing heart disease, stroke, and diabetes in different populations.
			<p />
			If you don't like walking, any activity that makes your heart work harder will suffice, as long as you do it long enough and often enough.
			<p />
			Keep in mind that 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a day is an excellent starting point, not an upper limit. Exercising longer, harder, or both can bring even greater health benefits.
			<p />
			If you are exercising mainly to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight, 30 minutes or so a day will work if you're careful about how much you eat. But you may need to exercise more, or more vigorously. A report from the Institute of Medicine concluded that it takes 60 minutes a day of moderate-intensity activity to maintain a healthy weight.
			<p />
			Among the 3,000 men and women who are part of the National Weight Control Registry, a select club that includes only people who lost more than 30 pounds and kept them off for at least a year, the average participant burns an average of 400 calories per day in physical activity. That's the equivalent of about an hour of brisk walking.
			<p />
			<h3>Feeling what's right</h3>
			The current recommendations for exercise and physical activity call for moderate intensity activities, or those measured at 3-6 METs (see table). Keep in mind that these are general recommendations aimed at the general population.
			<p />
			The problem with guidelines is that they try to cover as many people as possible. In other words, they aren't right for everyone. How much exercise you need depends on your genes, your diet, how much muscle and fat you carry on your frame, how fit you are, and your capacity for exercise.
			<p />
			A study of more 7,000 men who graduated from Harvard before 1950 suggests that older people, those who are out of shape, or those with disabilities may get as much benefit from 30 minutes of slower walking or other exercise as younger, more fit people get from the same amount of more intense activity.
			<p />
			In other words, if an exercise or physical activity feels hard, then it is probably doing your heart - and the rest of you - some good, even if it doesn't fall into the "moderate" category.
			<p />
			Don't get stuck in a rut, though. As your body adapts to exercise, you'll need to push yourself more and more to get the same cardiovascular workout. Another way to know that it's time to pick up the pace is if you see your weight or waist size start creeping up on you.
			<p />
			<h3>Beyond the heart</h3>
			When talking about the benefits of exercise, keeping the heart and blood vessels healthy usually gets most of the attention. For many older individuals, though, stretching and strength training exercises that barely raise the heart rate - and so aren't considered moderate at all - may be just as important. Such exercises can maintain or improve balance, muscle strength, and overall function.
			<p />
			<h3>Resistance Training</h3>
			Resistance training or weight training is probably the most neglected component of fitness programs but one of the most beneficial. Our body can basically be divided into 2 components. Fat mass consists of the body's fat store, while fat free mass is a combination of non-fat tissue such as muscle, bone, internal organs etc. An important part of fat free mass is lean body mass, which is essentially muscle.
			<p />
			Muscle is metabolically active tissue. This means that it utilizes calories to work, repair and refuel itself. Fat requires very few calories, it just kind of sits there. As we enter our mid to late twenties, we slowly start to lose muscle as part of the natural aging process. This means that the amount of calories we need each day starts to decrease and it becomes easier to gain weight. By engaging in regular strength training exercise, it is possible to decrease this loss of lean muscle tissue and even replace some that has been lost already. Studies have shown strength training to increase lean body mass, decrease fat mass and increase resting metabolic rate (a measurement of the amount of calories burned per day). These effects may make it easier to manage one's weight.
			<p />
			Another beneficial effect of resistance training pertains to bone health. In addition to weight bearing cardiovascular exercise, weight training has been shown to help fight osteoporosis. For example, in postmenopausal women, 2 strength training sessions a week for one year increased bone mineral density by 1%. A sedentary control group lost 2% in the same time period.
			<p />
			Finally, in older populations, resistance training can help maintain the ability to perform functional tasks such as walking, rising from a chair, climbing stairs and even carrying their own groceries.
			<p />
			Many people are intimidated by the idea of resistance training or are afraid of injury. They need not be. A great idea is to consult an expert. Consider hiring an exercise physiologist or personal trainer for a few sessions until you have the confidence to branch out on you own.

			<p />
			<h3>Flexibility Training</h3>
			Flexibility training or stretching exercise is another important part of overall fitness. It has been shown to increase range of motion, decrease muscle soreness associated with exercise and may decrease exercise related injury.
			<p />
			<h3>Tips for Getting Exercise Into Your Life</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Get off a stop or 2 earlier</b> during your bus or subway commute; walk the rest of the way.</li>
				<li>Purposefully <b>park you car a little further from the mall</b> or store. It may not seem like much, but over weeks and months, these minutes of exercise add up.</li>
				<li><b>Use the stairs</b> instead of elevators and escalators whenever possible.</li>
				<li>Consider <b>buying a piece of cardiovascular equipment for your home</b> (e.g. treadmill, bike, elliptical machine). Home models can be more reasonable than you think and you can't beat the convenience.</li>
				<li>When you get busy, try to combine your cardiovascular exercise with something that you do already. Hop on that piece of home equipment while watching TV, reading the newspaper or returning phone calls.</li>
				<li><b>Make it fun!</b> Try a new sport like tennis or rollerblading. The more that you enjoy exercise the more likely you are to stick to it.</li>
				<li><b>Make it social.</b> Walk with a friend, your spouse, or your family in the morning or evening.</li>
				<li><b>Keep an exercise log.</b> It will help to make you more accountable.</li>
				<li>Take a walk for 20 minutes of your lunch hour.</li>
				<li>Hire a personal trainer for a session or 2 to help you with your weight training and flexibility training. Then you'll have the confidence to branch out on your own.</li>
