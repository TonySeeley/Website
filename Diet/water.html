		<h2>Water</h2>
			<h3>Diet Experience</h3>
			During the program the dietitians continually stressed the importance of drinking water.  In fact they asked me to drink 64 fl oz a day (that's 8 8 fl oz glasses of water a day - which is a lot).  It also had to be WATER, not tea, coffee or any kind of soda or juice - just water.
			<p />
			I have to say this was made much easier due to the amazing tap water we have here in Washington state.  I think if I still lived in the UK it would have had to have been lots of bottled water (which of course gets pricey).
			<p />
			Although I no longer drink my 8 glasses of water a day, I do drink miles more than I used to.  I regularly drink water when working out, drink at least 1 glass or water at work during the day and often just drink water in restaurants.
			<p />
			<h3>General Information</h3>
			So here are some important facts about water:
			<ul>
				<li>Water is second only to oxygen in importance.</li>
				<li>70% of body weight is water.</li>
				<li>The nutrients we consume from food and beverages are transported from the intestine to the blood stream by water.</li>
				<li>Waste products are transported by water to the kidneys and eliminated from the body.</li>
				<li>The need for water increases in hot weather or while travelling on an airplane.</li>
			</ul>
			The tips we were given were:
			<ol>
				<li>Get good water.</li>
				<li>Choose a container that is convenient and appealing.</li>
				<li>Add ice and a slice of lemon for flavour.</li>
				<li>Make it a habit to drink;</li>
				<ul>
					<li>After waking up.</li>
					<li>Before a meal.</li>

					<li>After working out drink a glass.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Your brain will tell you you are thirsty when you have 25% deficiency.</li>
				<li>Caffeine and artificial sweeteners will continue to dehydrate you.</li>
				<li>If you become dehydrated, your body may turn on your hunger cravings.</li>
			</ol>
