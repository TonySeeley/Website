			<h2>About this site</h2>
			Everyone who knows me, knows I have recently lost a lot of weight.  In total to date it's about 130 lbs (9 stone 4 lbs).
			<p />
			I have been repeatedly asked by friends and family to write about this on the web site.  Rather than just write a news story I wanted to capture the details of the diet I followed.
			<p />
			I wanted to do this for a few reasons, firstly it's been very therapeutic for me to capture a lot of the information.  It has also spurned me on to continue to lose more.  Another reason was that some have asked how I did it so they too can try to shed a few pounds.
			<p />
			This diet has changed my life in more ways than I can explain here on a web site.  I'm fitter, healthier, and have probably increased my life expectancy by 20 years.  The difference to me is that I now get to watch my children grown up - something that was highly unlikely before.
			<p />
			I also took a number of pictures along the way and am currently doctoring the pictures that make them family friendly for a family site!  I hope to upload those someday.
			<p />
			As I currently live in the United States, I have to be very careful giving advice on a web site. This is a very litigious society, and at the end of the day I am neither a doctor nor a dietitian.
			<p />
			As a result I have to make a disclaimer about all the information contained in this part of the site.
			<p />
			<b>I have attempted to capture the information I have learnt to lose weight, anyone wishing to follow my experiences should seek professional medical advice before doing so.  I take no responsibility for anyone attempting to follow my example without medical approval first.</b>
			<p />
			In investigating alot of the information I included in this part of the site, I encountered numerous contradictions across the Internet.  It truly appears that nobody can really agree on the "best" way to lose weight. (Other than regular exercise and a sensible diet).
			<p />
			As a result I have relied heavily on the lessons learnt from the 20/20 Lifestyles program, and if I have misinterpreted any details or stated an incorrect fact (both real possibilities) I apologise.
			<p />
			Please treat this site for what it is - the ramblings of a reformed fatty who thinks he knows it all.
			<p />
			Enjoy.
