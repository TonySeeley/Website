			<h2>Why Diet?</h2>
			As far back as I can remember I've been overweight.  I think this started once I reached 9 or 10.  I don't know why, I have always put it down to unlucky genes.
			<p />
			I had a successful period of being, what I'll call a "normal weight" in my early twenties.  I always attributed this to the amount of exercise I did while in the armed forces.
			<p />
			In 1987 I had a road traffic accident and broke my back.  This excused me from any more exercise and the pounds began to climb.
			<p />
			In 1986 I was 12 stone 7 (175 lbs), by the time I left the Army in 1992, I had reached a weight of 19 stone (266 lbs).  To be honest, this was entirely down to poor diet and little exercise, which was mainly due to laziness; my back had healed sufficiently by then for me to exercise again.  I had also been married for 4 years by this time and I guess I had become <i>contented</i> (I hate that word) and just let myself go.
			<p />
			I left the army to sit behind a computer, and worked in an environment where people would actually fetch my food so I could continue to code.  Although this was productive for the company, my weight continued to balloon.
			<p />
			In 2002 an opportunity arose to move to the States, where lived the highest number of obese people in the world.  As a guy who likes his food, things didn't look good.
			<p />
			In January 2003 Lisa, James and I arrived in Seattle, and, like the locals discovered the benefits of eating out.  I can't say how much I weighed at this time, as I had stopped getting on scales a long time ago.  However I would guess I was between 23 and 24 stone (330 - 340 lbs).
			<p />
			By July 2003, I had reached 24 stone 4 lbs (340 lbs), my heaviest to date.  I had also just had my 40th birthday and become the proud father of a baby girl (Abi).  I think the final nail in the coffin was being told by my doctor that I had dangerously high blood pressure and cholesterol and needed to go onto medication.
			<p />
			The time had defiantly come to make some life style changes.  My concerns of course being I would not be around to see my children grow; something that was confirmed by my doctor.  At best I could expect type II diabetes and future heart disease.  I probably wouldn't make 65.
			<p />
			One of the benefits of moving to America was the health cover and support provided by Microsoft.  Microsoft already provided an employment benefit of being a member of one of the best health clubs and gyms I have ever seen, but for the over weight there was more.
			<p />
			The health club the company used had a weight loss program, called 20/20 lifestyles.  This program (more info on another page) guaranteed weight loss.  The problem was the program was $9,000 (about £5,600).  Fortunately (if that's the word), if you had a body mass index (BMI) of over 30, Microsoft would pay the first $6,000.
			<p />
			My BMI was 45, this made me what was termed "Morbidly Obese", and eligible for the Microsoft support.
			<p />
			So, on Monday 28th July 2003, after 3 weeks of application forms, doctors examinations and blood work, I started the program.
			<p />
			This part of my web site plots my successes and goals.
			<p />
			I have learnt so much about nutrition, diet and exercise; I felt this was a good medium to share.
			<p />
			If nothing else, by publishing my progress, it could act as an incentive in the future to continue to my ideal weight.
			<p />
			Hopefully, some of my experiences will be of interest, and even helpful to those who wish to follow my lead and shed a few pounds.
