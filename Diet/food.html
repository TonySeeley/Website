			<h2>Food</h2>
			If you look at the meal tracking you will see that over a period of time I added more and more foods to my diet.<br>
			<br>
			The logic behind this is that you start with nothing, then slowly add new foods while watching what affect the new food has on your progress/weigh loss.<br>
			<br>
			The idea being we are all different and different foods affect us all in different ways.<br>
			<br>
			Throughout the program you are encouraged to eat 5 times a day.  This should include breakfast, a morning snack, lunch, an afternoon snack and dinner.<br>
			<br>
			I kept this up for quite a few weeks but found it suited me personally better, to move my morning snack to early evening (after dinner) as this is when I wanted to pick at foods.  This was OK'd by my dietitian so that's what I did.<br>
			<br>
			Eating regular meals serves two purposes.<br>
			<ol>
			<li>Firstly, it keeps hunger at bay.  If you always have some food inside you, you're not hungry.  Also by not leaving a long time between meals, you don't develop that "I'm starving" feeling and eat everything in sight.<br>
			<br>
			<li>Secondly, regular meals keep your metabolism going (and it's an active metabolism that burns fat).  The analogy used to explain this to me was your body is like a fire, you have to keep feeding it to burn, let it die down and it takes a lot more wood to get it going again.<br>
			</ol>
			The table below summarizes how and when foods were added to the diet over the 20 weeks.<br>
