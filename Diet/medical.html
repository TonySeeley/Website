			<h2>Medical Information</h2>
			OK, so we have ascertained that I was obese.  In fact Morbidly Obese (got a nice ring about it don't you think?).
			<p />
			As mentioned under Why Diet I was also diagnosed by my doctor with high cholesterol and high blood pressure.  Both terms I had heard of and knew were bad, but in truth knew little about.
			<p />
			So then I join the 20/20 program and they tell me I have Insulin Resistance (or at least all the common symptoms of Insulin Resistance).
			<p />
			When you get all this information the first typical reaction (for me anyway) is to have a cream bun.  I fought this desire and decided to do some research instead.
			<p />
			Actually under the 20/20 program they do give you quite a lot of information about each medical condition, but I wanted to know more.
			<p />
			So, I hit the internet and searched for each condition and learnt quite a lot.
			<p />
			The pages that follow under the Medical Information section were created from one or more web sites that helped explain my medical state.
			<p />
			I have to say when I read about each condition two interesting things happened.<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Firstly I got scared!  This in itself acted as a sizable motivator to do something positive and not reach for that cream bun!
				<p />
				<li>Secondly I realized how common these conditions were.  This was a bit of a shock.  Yes sure, identifying someone who is obese is easy, but the other medical conditions are harder to diagnose.  It did make me wonder how many people there are out there walking about with high cholesterol or blood pressure and just don't know.
			</ol>
			There are of course lots of other obese related conditions out there, but this is my site so I have only included the conditions I had.
			<p />
			Finally I would like to state that at the point of writing this I am in complete remission on all.  My cholesterol and blood pressure are normal and I am no longer obese (let alone morbidly obese).
			<p />
			Medically I am still officially termed "Over Weight" and have about 20 lbs to lose (that is to get my BMI down to 25).
			<p />
			In truth I doubt I will get to 190 lbs, and don't really care, although I will continue to try to get to 200 lbs (which is my personal goal).
