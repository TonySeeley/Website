			<h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
			<h3>Diet Experience</h3>
			The diet early on removed all carbohydrates, but this was just to flush the system out.  After the first week low glycemic carbs were introduced in the form of vegetables.  By week six I was allowed fruit too.<p>
		
			Beans came in in week eight and my first grain in week twelve.<p>
		
			As far as grains are concerned I only eat whole wheat grains, so I never touched white bread.  I also had cereals with whole wheat too.  Things like Shredded Wheat and All Bran being the best.<p>
		
			<h3>General Information</h3>
			Carbohydrates come from a wide array of foods - bread, beans, milk, popcorn, potatoes, cookies, spaghetti, corn, and cherry pie. They also come in a variety of forms. The most common and abundant are sugars, fibers, and starches. The basic building block of a carbohydrate is a sugar molecule, a simple union of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Starches and fibers are essentially chains of sugar molecules. Some contains hundreds of sugars. Some chains are straight, others branch wildly.<p>
		
			Carbohydrates were once grouped into two main categories. Simple carbohydrates included sugars such as fruit sugar (fructose), corn or grape sugar (dextrose or glucose), and table sugar (sucrose). Complex carbohydrates included everything made of three or more linked sugars. Simple sugars were considered bad and complex carbohydrates good. The picture is much more complicated than that.<p>
		
			The digestive system handles all carbohydrates in much the same way - it breaks them down (or tries to break them down) into single sugar molecules, since only these are small enough to cross into the bloodstream. It also converts most digestible carbohydrates into glucose (also known as blood sugar), because cells are designed to use this as a universal energy source.<p>
		
			Fiber is an exception. It is put together in such a way that it can't be broken down into sugar molecules, and so passes through the body undigested.<p>
		
			<b>When Sugar Management Goes Awry</b>
			<p />
			Digestible carbohydrates are broken down in the intestine into their simplest form, sugar, which then enters the blood. As blood sugar levels rise, special cells in the pancreas churn out more and more insulin, a hormone that signals cells to absorb blood sugar for energy or storage. As cells sponge up blood sugar, its levels in the bloodstream fall back to a preset minimum. So do insulin levels.<p>
		
			In some people, this cycle doesn't work properly. People with type 1 diabetes (once called insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes) don't make enough insulin, so their cells can't absorb sugar. People with type 2 diabetes (once called non-insulin dependent or adult onset diabetes) usually start out with a different problem - their cells don't respond well to insulin's "open up for sugar" signal. This condition, known as insulin resistance, causes both blood sugar and insulin levels to stay high long after eating. Over time, the heavy demands made on the insulin-making cells wears them out, and insulin production slows, then stops.<p>
		
			Insulin resistance isn't just a blood sugar problem. It has also been linked with a variety of other problems, including high blood pressure, high levels of triglycerides, low HDL (good) cholesterol, heart disease, and possibly some cancers.<p>
		
			Genes, a sedentary lifestyle, being overweight, and eating a diet filled with foods that cause big spikes in blood sugar can all promote insulin resistance. Data from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study suggests that cutting back on refined grains and eating more whole grains in their place can improve insulin sensitivity.<p>
		
			<h3>No Carbohydrates?</h3>
		
			Some popular diets, particularly the Atkins diet, treat carbohydrates as if they are evil, the root of all body fat and excess weight. While there is some evidence that a low-carbohydrate diet may help people lose weight more quickly than a low-fat diet, no one knows the long-term effects of eating little or no carbohydrates. Equally worrisome is the inclusion of unhealthy fats in some of these diets.<p>
		
			<h3>Adding Good Carbohydrates</h3>
		
			Carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, and grains should give you the bulk of your calories. For optimal health, get your grains intact from foods such as whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole-grain pasta, and other possibly unfamiliar grains like quinoa, whole oats, and bulgur. Not only will these foods help protect you against a range of chronic diseases, they can also please your palate and your eyes.<p>
		
			Until recently, you could only get whole-grain products in organic or non-traditional stores. Today they are popping up in more and more mainstream grocery stores. Here are some suggestions for adding more whole grains to your diet:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Start the day with whole grains.</b> If you're partial to hot cereals, try old-fashioned or steel-cut oats. If you're a cold cereal person, look for one that lists whole wheat, oats, barley, or other grain first on the ingredient list.<p>
		
				<li><b>Use whole-grain breads for lunch or snacks.</b> Check the label to make sure that whole wheat or other whole grain is the first ingredient listed.<p>
		
				<li><b>Bag the potatoes.</b> Instead, try brown rice or even "newer" grains like bulgur, wheat berries, millet, or hulled barley with your dinner.<p>
		
				<li><b>Pick up some whole wheat pasta.</b> If the whole-grain products are too chewy for you, look for those that are made with half whole-wheat flour and half white flour.
			</ul>
