			<h2>Fats</h2>
			<h3>Diet Experience</h3>
			<p />
			Fats are important despite all the low fat diets of old.  Some fats are called essential as they cannot be manufactured by the body.
			<p />
			As a result, we had to ensure we had enough "good" fats in our diet.
			<p />
			This basically meant lots of unsaturated fats especially Omega 3 Fatty acids.
			<p />
			So I was encouraged to eat a lot of oily fish like Salmon and Mackerel.
			<p />
			I had to count my grams of fat though to ensure I didn't have too much.
			<p />
			One interesting piece of advice was I was told to start every morning with natural peanut butter (one tablespoon to be precise).
			<p />
			The logic behind this was that peanut butter has a low Glycemic index and takes a long time to turn to sugar in the blood and just as long to be adsorbed.  Having a consistent level of blood sugar early in the day staves off hunger.  So that peanut butter provided some good fat and stopped me from feeling hungry till lunch.
			<p />
			<h3>General Information</h3>
			<p />
			There are four different kinds of fats in human nutrition. Fat is categorized according to its saturation. Saturation refers to the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the fat molecule. When a fat molecule contains the maximum number of hydrogen atoms, it is said to be "saturated." It is called "hard fat," because it remains hard at room temperature. If one pair of hydrogen atoms is missing, the molecule is said to be "monounsaturated." An example is olive oil. Monounsaturated fat is the healthiest, most easily digested form of fat. If more than one pair of hydrogen atoms is missing, it is said to be "polyunsaturated." These are the thin oils commonly used for frying and for salad dressing.
			<p />
			If an unsaturated vegetable fat is altered by adding hydrogen atoms, which did not exist in nature, the fat molecule is said to be "hydrogenated." Hydrogenation transforms the shape of a fatty acid to a "trans" form. You can visualize this by imagining a square-shaped molecule being transformed to a circle-shaped molecule. This molecule does not occur in nature, and the body has difficulty digesting it. This is the problem with margarine - it contains hydrogenated, trans-fatty acids. Studies show this type of molecule to be more associated with artery disease than the saturated ("hard") fat found in butter. Hydrogenated fat also is commonly associated with junk food: potato chips. cookies, etc. It is very hard to digest and is strongly associated with vascular disease.
			<p />
			There are a two fatty acids which cannot be manufactured by the body and must be consumed from outside sources. These "essential fatty acids" are linoleic (Omega 3) acid and linolenic (Omega 6) acid.  Animal foods, except for fish and poultry, are low in Omega 3 acid, but they can meet human needs. Omega 3 acid is abundant however in fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, trout and sardines) and in some vegetables. Omega 6 acid is abundant in both vegetables and animal foods, and it is practically impossible to be in short supply. However some evidence exists to suggest the ratio of Omega 6 to Omega 3 fatty acids should not exceed 4:1.  All other fatty substances can be manufatured by the body.
			<p />
			<h3>The Result of Excess Fat Intake</h3>
			<p />
			The body can cope with a relatively small intake of excess fats. What constitutes an excess is in debate; however, you can be sure that more than 40% of your calories from fat is an excess. To get an excess of fat in your diet, you must eat a junk-food and/or animal-source diet, not properly balanced with plant-source food.
			<p />
			The association between excess fat and degenerative diseases, such as vascular heart disease and arthritis, is definitively established. The association between excess dietary fat and the development of a variety of cancers also is well established. Vascular disease, caused by the peroxidation of excess fats, also causes generalized vascular disease throughout the body, eventually causing kidney, pancreas, and liver failure, as well as cerebrovascular clogging with resulting strokes.
			<p />
			The litany of adverse conditions caused by excess fat intake does not end here. We could talk about acne, obesity, increased risk of heart attack, etc. Most people are trying to do something about it. Unfortunately, most are doing the wrong thing.
			<p />
			One of the wrong things you can do is switch from butter to margarine, which contains hydrogenated vegetable oil, which is worse for your body than butter fat.

			<h3>Fats At A Glance</h3>
			<b>Saturated Fats</b>
			<p />
			<ul>
				<li><b>Sources:</b> Annimal fats such as lard, whole milk, cheese, cream, butter, egg yolks, red meat, bacon, sausage, and hot dogs.  Plant sources are coconut, palm kernel oils, and cocoa butter.
				<li>Solid at room temperature (with the exception of milk, cream and eggs).
				<li><b>Increases total cholesterol, increases LDL (bad) cholesterol, increases triglycerides.</b>
			</ul>
			<b>Hydrogenated Fats (trans fatty acids)</b>
			<p />
			<ul>
				<li>Created by adding hydrogen to liquid oils, making them more self-stable and less prone to rancidity.
				<li><b>Sources:</b> Stick margarines, vegetable shortening, deep-fried foods, creads, crackers, cookies, scones, muffins, cakes, frosting, candy, instant rice, instant pasta, and some peanut butters (Skippy/Jif).
				<li><b>Increases total cholesterol, increases LDL (bad) cholesterol, decreases HDL (good) cholesterol.</b>
				<li>Interferes with essential fatty acid metabolism (can cause deficiency).
			</ul>
			<b>Unsaturated Fats</b>
			<p />
			<b><u>Monounsaturated Fats</u></b>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Sources:</b> Olive oil, peanut oil, natural peanut butter, avocado, and most nuts.
				<li>Liquid at room temperature.
				<li><b>Decreases total cholesterol, decreases LDL (bad) cholesterol, decreases triglycerides.</b>
			</ul>
			<b><u>Polyunsaturated Fats</u></b>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Sources:</b> Pumpkin and sunflower seeds, corn oil, soybean oil, safflower and sunflower oils.
				<li>Liquid at room temperature.
				<li><b>Decreases total cholesterol, decreases LDL (bad) cholesterol, decreases triglycerides.</b>
			</ul>
			<b><u>Omega 3 Fatty Acids</u></b>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Sources:</b> Cold water fish such as salmon, mackerel, trout, sardines and tuna.  Plant sources include flaxseeds and flaxseed oil; walnuts amd walnut oil, canola oil and soy oil.  Animal sources include grass fed beef, poultry, dairy and omega 3 eggs.
				<li><b>Decreases total cholesterol, decreases LDL (bad) cholesterol, decreases triglycerides, increases HDL (good) cholesterol.</b>
				<li>Omega 3 fatty acids also <b>reduce platelet aggregation</b> (makes the blood less sticky); <b>decreases inflamation</b> in the body (including osteoarthritis); and <b>lessons depression</b> in some people.
			</ul>
			<b><u>Omega 6 Fatty Acids</u></b>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Sources:</b> Vegetable oils like corn, sunflower and safflower.
				<li>Can cause inflammation, blood clotting tumor groths and accelerated aging.
				<li><b>The higher ratio of Omega 6 to Omage 3 fatty acids, the higher the chances of getting the disorders mentioned above.</b> However, remember this is still an essential fatty acid.  The recommended ratio between Omega 6 and Omega 3 is 4:1.
