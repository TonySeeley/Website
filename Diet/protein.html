			<h2>Protein</h2>
			<h3>Diet Experience</h3>
			<p />
			The recommendation from the dietitians on the program was basically stick to chicken and fish.
			<p />
			They like you to have chicken as it's low in saturated fat, and they like you to have oily fish (like salmon) because it's high in Omega 3 fatty acids.  So they encourage you to pick these as proteins.
			<p />
			Another protein we found (and was approved by the dietitians) and was really easy to use and tasted great was Egg Beaters. Egg Beaters are basically coloured egg whites (just eggs without the yolk).  They colour them yellow so they look more appealing. I know it sounds horrid, but you buy them in cartons here in the US and they taste great in omelettes.  You can even get flavoured varieties.
			<p />
			Egg whites are really good for you as they contain loads of protein but don't have the saturated fat that comes in the yolk.
			<p />
			You are allowed to have red meat but are encouraged to have very lean cuts, again to keep the saturated fats to a minimum.
			<p />
			We also found a sausage range called Isernio.  The Isernio sausages are made with very lean meat and very little fat and again taste great.
			<p />
			For snacks I regularly got my protein from nuts and special protein bars.  The bars I ate were called Balance Outdoor.  You do need to be very careful when you pick protein bars though.  Check the fat type and content and ensure it's high in fiber and low in sugar (rule of threes - check out the <a href="whatwhen.html">What, When & How</a> page.)
			<p />
			<h3>General Information</h3>
			<p />
			Take away the water and about 75 percent of your weight is protein. This chemical family is found throughout the body. It's in muscle, bone, skin, hair, and virtually every other body part or tissue. It makes up the enzymes that power many chemical reactions and the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. At least 10,000 different proteins make you what you are and keep you that way.
			<p />
			Twenty or so basic building blocks, called amino acids, provide the raw material for all proteins. Following genetic instructions, the body strings together amino acids. Some genes call for short chains, others are blueprints for long chains that fold, origami-like, into intricate, three-dimensional structures.
			<p />
			Because the body doesn't store amino acids, as it does fats or carbohydrates, it needs a daily supply of amino acids to make new protein.
			<p />
			Eight of these amino acids are "essential," meaning that they cannot be synthesized in the body even though they are necessary for life. Essential amino acids must be consumed from sources outside the body.
			<p />
			An ideal intake of protein is 1.0 gram per kilogram of body weight. Excess protein is defined as more than 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight. For an average-size, seventy-kilogram man, this amounts to 70 x 1.6 = 112 grams.
			<p />
			<h3>Can you get too much protein?</h3>
			<p />
			Digesting it releases acids that the body usually neutralizes with calcium and other buffering agents in the blood. Eating lots of protein, such as the amounts recommended in the so-called low-carb or no-carb diets, takes lots of calcium. Some of this may be pulled from bone. Following a high-protein diet for a few weeks probably won't have much effect on bone strength. Doing it for a long time, though, could weaken bone.
			<p />
			<h3>All protein isn't alike</h3>
			<p />
			Some of the protein you eat contains all the amino acids needed to build new proteins. This kind is called complete protein. Animal sources of protein tend to be complete. Other protein sources lack one or more amino acids that the body can't make from scratch or create by modifying another amino acid. Called incomplete proteins, these usually come from fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts.
			<p />
			Vegetarians need to be aware of this. To get all the amino acids needed to make new protein - and thus to keep the body's systems in good shape - people who don't eat meat, fish, poultry, eggs, or dairy products should eat a variety of protein-containing foods each day.
			<p />
			<h3>The protein package</h3>
			<p />
			Animal protein and vegetable protein probably have the same effects on health. It's the protein package that's likely to make a difference. A 6-ounce broiled Porterhouse steak is a great source of complete protein - 38 grams worth. But it also delivers 44 grams of fat, 16 of them saturated. That's almost 3/4 of the recommended daily intake for saturated fat. The same amount of salmon gives you 34 grams of protein and 18 grams of fat, 4 of them saturated. A cup of cooked lentils has 18 grams of protein, but under 1 gram of fat.
			<p />
			The bottom line is that it's important to pay attention to what comes along with the protein in your food choices. If you are partial to beef, stick with the leanest cuts. Fish or poultry are excellent alternatives. Even better options are vegetable sources of protein, such as beans, nuts, and whole grains.
			<p />
			<h3>The bottom line</h3>
			<p />
			To make this simple, all you need to remember is to consume, three times each day, about the amount of protein source which could be held in the palm of your hand - about the size of a chicken breast - constituting about 33% sof your calories. With that, have whatever fat comes associated with that protein. Add high-fiber vegetables, the equivalent of three handfuls.
