			<h2>20/20 Lifestyles</h2>
			20/20 Lifestyles was founded by Dr Mark Dedominico, the PRO Sports Club's chairman.
			<p />
			Dedominico was a heart surgeon who authored a paper back in 1967 on what is now called Coronary Bypass Surgery.  Dedominico is quite a character, and talks about how he was sick of operating on obese patients.  He basically decided to come up with a weight loss program for his new health club to try and reduce the number of obese related illnesses of his members.
			<p />
			I'm not sure how long the 20/20 lifestyles program has been running, but there are very few programs of its kind in the world.  This has mainly to do with cost.  To provide the necessary care and instruction the program costs loads of money.  Most health clubs would not be able to run such a program as their members would not be able to afford it.  20/20 lifestyles is only possible due to Microsoft backing.
			<p />
			At any one time, approximately 300 people are on the program.
			<p />
			The following explains what the program provides and how it works.
			<p />
			Before you start you have to undergo a physical examination and a number of blood tests.  The blood tests are carried out to identify your starting metabolic condition.
			<p />
			Your blood pressure is taken and then you are measured, (chest, waist, hips, arm and leg circumferences).  Your level of fitness is assessed using a tread mill that over time speeds up and raises in incline.  Based on your age, a maximum heart rate is reached and then your recovery is measured.  Finally, your flexibility is measured.
			<p />
			All this information is recorded and the tests are repeated every 5 weeks to measure your level of improvement.
			<p />
			The blood work is only taken three times, at the beginning and end of the program and at the 10 week point.
			<p />
			I have included my results on the results page, but basically I had high blood pressure and cholesterol.
			<p />
			You fill in thousands of forms and hand over a cheque for $3000.  They then give you a plastic water bottle (I was quite disappointed at this time).
			<p />
			You are then assigned a personal trainer, dietitian, doctor and psychologist.
			<p />
			You see the doctor every five weeks, the psychologist every five weeks on your own and weekly for the first eight weeks with a group of other guys.
			<p />
			You meet with the dietitian once a week and the personal trainer three times a week for one and half hour sessions.
			<p />
			The club provides 10, 15 and 20 week programs.  The one that's right for you really depends on how obese you are.  As I was massively obese, I went for the 20 week program.
			<p />
			At the end of the program (be it the 10, 15 or 20 week one), you go into maintenance.
			<p />
			This reduces your meetings with the dietitian down to once every five weeks and twice a week with the personal trainer for an hour each time.  Maintenance lasts 10 weeks.
			<p />
			At the end of maintenance you are on your own.  For some, they may have reached their ideal weight by this time, for others (like me) you still have some way to go.
			<p />
			For the first 12 weeks every time you meet your personal trainer you get to watch a 10-15 minute film while you warm up.  The films teach you about nutrition and vitamins, and the science of why you are obese.  More importantly they teach you what you can do about it.
			<p />
			When you start on the program, most food types are not allowed.  You are given a limited daily calorie and fat allowance and basically told which foods you can eat.
			<p />
			Your first week is not much fun.  All you can eat are protein shakes and meat.  You are given protein shakes at the beginning to flush out all the carbohydrates from your system (and to give you a good weight loss for week one).
			<p />
			You are also given vitamins, fish oil and calcium tablets at the beginning that you must take each day.
			<p />
			Each week you are given new foods and your dietitian and personal trainer monitor your weight loss and hunger levels to try and identify which foods affect you negatively (the idea being here everyone is different).
			<p />
			After about 18 weeks you basically get all the food groups back (with a few exceptions) and you are eating normally (although still with a reduced daily calorie and fat allowance).
			<p />
			You personal trainer reviews your starting fitness level and designs a program to complement your change of diet.
			<p />
			Typically in your hour and half, you do 15 minutes warm up (to the video), 40 minutes cardiovascular exercise (running on a tread mill etc.), 30 minutes weight training and 5 minutes stretching.
			<p />
			For the first 10 weeks my trainer took my blood pressure at the beginning and end of every session.  When I reached normal levels, this dropped to once a week.
			<p />
			When I started, all I could do was walk on the tread mill, run at a low level on a cross trainer, and cycle for a short while.  My weight lifting was pretty pathetic too.
			<p />
			As time went by, I found I could do more and work harder.  Eventually I was running and lifting considerably heavier weights.  I won't lie and say this was easy, as every time I got comfortable, we would make things harder (run faster, lift more).  This is the funny thing about exercise, it never gets easy, if it's easy you're probably not exercising properly.
			<p />
			One of the side effects of all this exercise was I found I slept really well at night.  You may think that this could be attributed to the fact that I was always knackered :-), but this wasn't the case.  In fact I have never had so much energy (I found I even started running up stairs at home - something I never did before).
			<p />
			So what have I learned from all this?
			<p />
			Well firstly, this is not a diet in the traditional sense of the word.  At the time of writing I am three weeks into maintenance and have just got through Christmas.  The way I eat now, is the way I will continue to eat.  I don't eat potatoes, bananas, corn, white bread, rice or pasta, and I plan on keeping them out of my diet in the future.
			<p />
			Sure every now and then I will have one of those foods, but they will not be part of my staple diet.
			<p />
			In truth, I really enjoy the foods I eat now; eating is not my personal challenge.
			<p />
			Exercise is really important.  This is my weakness.  I am basically lazy and this won't go away.  As a result I am learning new sports and taking up new hobbies that encourage an active life style.
			<p />
			In Winter I ski and in Summer I hit the hills around Washington to mountain bike, I also became a certified scuba diver last year.  All year round I play racquetball and run.  Basically I do as many different exercises I can to keep it interesting and fun.
			<p />
			My biggest lessons are related to nutrition.  I now know what I can and can't eat and why.  I now know how much I can eat and why.  (Most of this will be explained in other pages on the site).
			<p />
			If nothing else I have been educated.
			<p />
			20/20 lifestyles is not about losing weight - weight loss is just a side effect.  It's more about eating healthily and exercising regularly.  Finding the right balance for you individually.
			<p />
			I  may not reach my perfect weight (although I am still keen to try), but I will eat better and be fitter than I have been for 15 years.
