			<h2>Fiber</h2>
			<h3>Diet Experience</h3>
			Fiber tends to mean carbs, so you have to be careful what you have.
			<p />
			The important thing that was stressed on the diet was that you have to have some fiber to "keep you regular".
			<p />
			This was achieved early on by having a powdered fiber supplement every day early on in the diet.
			<p />
			When more carbohydrates were introduced along with grains, I could start to ease off the supplement.
			<p />
			Having said that I always keep some powdered fiber in the house.  I still regularly take Citrucel or Metamucil, at least on those days when I know my fiber intake is low.
			<p />
			<h3>General Information</h3>
			Fiber is one of those nutrients that many of us know is important but that remains a bit of a mystery. Exactly what is it? What are the best sources of fiber? And what are its health benefits?
			<p />
			Basically, the term fiber refers to carbohydrates that cannot be digested. Fiber is present in all plants that are eaten for food, including fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes. However, not all fiber is the same, and there are a number of ways to categorize it. One is by its source or origin. For example, fiber from grains is referred to as cereal fiber. Another way of categorizing fiber is by how easily it dissolves in water. Soluble fiber partially dissolves in water. Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water. These differences are important when it comes to fiber's effect on your risk of developing certain diseases.

			Current recommendations suggest that adults consume 20-35 grams of dietary fiber per day. Children over age 2 should consume an amount equal to or greater than their age plus 5 grams per day. Yet the average American eats only 14-15 grams of dietary fiber a day.
			<b>Health Effects of Eating Fiber</b><p />
			Long heralded as part of a healthy diet, fiber appears to reduce the risk of developing various conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, diverticular disease, and constipation. Despite what many people may think, however, fiber probably has little, if any effect on colon cancer risk.
			<p />
			<b>The Bottom Line Recommendations for Fiber Intake</b><p />
			Fiber is an important part of a healthy diet, and you should get a least the minimum recommended amount of 20-35 grams of dietary fiber per day for adults. For children over age 2, the recommended intake is the child's age + 5 grams. The best sources are fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts and legumes, and whole-grain foods.
			<p />
			<b>Some tips for increasing fiber intake:</b><p />
			<ul>
				<li>Eat whole fruits instead of drinking fruit juices.<p>
				<li>Replace white rice, bread, and pasta with brown rice and whole-grain products.<p>
				<li>Choose whole-grain cereals for breakfast.<p>
				<li>Snack on raw vegetables instead of chips, crackers, or chocolate bars.<p>
				<li>Substitute legumes for meat two to three times per week in chili and soups.<p>
				<li>Experiment with international dishes (such as Indian or Middle Eastern) that use whole grains and legumes as part of the main meal (as in Indian dahls) or in salads (for example, tabbouleh).
