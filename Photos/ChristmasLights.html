			<h2>Christmas Lights</h2>
			December 2006
			<p />
			It's very common in the US to decorate your house at Christmas.  Lisa has been dying to do this for years and now we live in a location where it's encouraged, I have found it harder to say no! (Plus to be honest I quite like it too).
			<p />
			So I decided to get some lights up.  Now you can hire people to come round your house and do this for you, but as I'm quite cheap I decided to do it myself, I mean how hard can it be?
			<p />
			So I sent Lisa off to Target (her favorite store) and told her to get some lights.  She came back with over 2000 lights.  So I got out my ladder a hammer and load of nails and climbed up onto the roof to put the lights up.
			<p />
			The first year I did this it took about 5 hours to decorate the house, but once the nails were up, it became much easier on subsequent years.  Now I can put the lights up in an hour, and take them down after Christmas is about 45 minutes.  I don't even use a ladder!  I now climb out of the bonus room window and run around on the roof.  Lisa hates this and can't watch - say's it's too scary.  But it's the fastest way to do the job.
			<p />
			Anyway I think the pic looks great.  This is from 2006 but it looks the same every year.
			<p />
			Hope you like it.
