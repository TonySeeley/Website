			<h2>James & Abi 2010 Home Studio Photos</h2>
			20th March 2010
			<p />			
			I've started taking pictures at home and took these shots of James and Abi.
			<p />
			I was looking at the 2009 school shots and can't believe how much James has changed in a year.  He has grown up so much and changed from that boy to a young man.
			<p />
			Unfortunately this means that he has become a teenager :-(  For those of you who know who "Kevin & Perry" is, you will understand.   James has become Kevin.
			<p />
			We were kind of expecting this I guess but now it's here it really sucks!  We are hoping this won't last too long.  On a positive note Abi is lovely to have around, still very much the princess (just wish she would stop talking).
			<p />
			Oh well, can't have everything.
